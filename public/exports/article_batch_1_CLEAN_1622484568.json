            "abstract": "Parasitoid wasps of the family Ichneumonidae are one of the most diverse and species-rich groups of organisms with a worldwide distribution. We here describe seven new ichneumonid fossil species and two new genera from a remarkable insect fossil site, the Eocene Messel Pit in Germany (~47Ma). The unique fossil preservation allows us to place five out of the seven new species unequivocally in extant subfamilies and genera. For the first time, lobed claws which are a clear synapomorphy for the subfamily Pimplinae, are observed in a fossil, making the newly described Scambus fossilobus sp. nov. the oldest unequivocal representative of the group. We also describe a fossil of Labeninae (Trigonator macrocheirus gen. et sp. nov.), an ichneumonid subfamily that was until now believed to be an exclusively Gondwanan element. Furthermore, the newly described Rhyssella vera sp. nov., Xanthopimpla messelensis sp. nov., and X. praeclara sp. nov. provide evidence that these extant genera date back as far as the Early\/Middle Eocene. In contrast to the clear placement of most of the newly described species, we were unable to place Polyhelictes bipolarus gen. et sp. nov. and Mesornatus markovici gen. et sp. nov. in an ichneumonid subfamily, mostly due to the high levels of homoplasy found in this group. These findings on the one hand demonstrate the need for a more rigorous approach in the taxonomic placement of fossil ichneumonids, and on the other hand provide more precise minimum ages for several ichneumonid genera and subfamilies.",

            "abstract": "Additive manufacturing with fused deposition modeling (FDM) is currently optimized for a wide range of research and commercial applications. The major disadvantage of FDM-created products is their low quality and structural defects (porosity), which impose an obstacle to utilizing them in functional prototyping and direct digital manufacturing of objects intended to contact with gases and liquids. This article describes a simple and efficient approach for assessing the quality of 3D printed objects. Using this approach it was shown that the wall permeability of a printed object depends on its geometric shape and is gradually reduced in a following series: cylinder > cube > pyramid > sphere > cone. Filament feed rate, wall geometry and G-code-defined wall structure were found as primary parameters that influence the quality of 3D-printed products. Optimization of these parameters led to an overall increase in quality and improvement of sealing properties. It was demonstrated that high quality of 3D printed objects can be achieved using routinely available printers and standard filaments.",

            "abstract": "In this study, we defined a new parameter, referred to as the cardiac stress index (CSI), using a nonlinear detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) of heart rate (HR). Our study aimed to incorporate the CSI into a cycling based fatigue monitoring system developed in our previous work so the muscle fatigue and cardiac stress can be both continuously and quantitatively assessed for subjects undergoing the cycling exercise. By collecting electrocardiogram (ECG) signals, the DFA scaling exponent \u03b1 was evaluated on the RR time series extracted from a windowed ECG segment. We then obtained the running estimate of \u03b1 by shifting a one-minute window by a step of 20 seconds so the CSI, defined as the percentage of all the less-than-one \u03b1 values, can be synchronously updated every 20 seconds. Since the rating of perceived exertion (RPE) scale is considered as a convenient index which is commonly used to monitor subjective perceived exercise intensity, we then related the Borg RPE scale value to the CSI in order to investigate and quantitatively characterize the relationship between exercise-induced fatigue and cardiac stress. Twenty-two young healthy participants were recruited in our study. Each participant was asked to maintain a fixed pedaling speed at a constant load during the cycling exercise. Experimental results showed that a decrease in DFA scaling exponent \u03b1 or an increase in CSI was observed during the exercise. In addition, the Borg RPE scale and CSI were positively correlated, suggesting that the factors due to cardiac stress might also contribute to fatigue state during physical exercise. Since the CSI can effectively quantify the cardiac stress status during physical exercise, our system may be used in sports medicine, or used by cardiologists who carried out stress tests for monitoring heart condition in patients with heart diseases.",

            "abstract": "The healing of bone defects is a challenge for both tissue engineering and modern orthopaedics. This problem has been addressed through the study of scaffold constructs combined with mechanoregulatory theories, disregarding the influence of chemical factors and their respective delivery devices. Of the chemical factors involved in the bone healing process, bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2) has been identified as one of the most powerful osteoinductive proteins. The aim of this work is to develop and validate a mechano-chemical regulatory model to study the effect of BMP-2 on the healing of large bone defects in silico. We first collected a range of quantitative experimental data from the literature concerning the effects of BMP-2 on cellular activity, specifically proliferation, migration, differentiation, maturation and extracellular matrix production. These data were then used to define a model governed by mechano-chemical stimuli to simulate the healing of large bone defects under the following conditions: natural healing, an empty hydrogel implanted in the defect and a hydrogel soaked with BMP-2 implanted in the defect. For the latter condition, successful defect healing was predicted, in agreement with previous in vivo experiments. Further in vivo comparisons showed the potential of the model, which accurately predicted bone tissue formation during healing, bone tissue distribution across the defect and the quantity of bone inside the defect. The proposed mechano-chemical model also estimated the effect of BMP-2 on cells and the evolution of healing in large bone defects. This novel in silico tool provides valuable insight for bone tissue regeneration strategies.",

Earlier reports demonstrated that the deletion of the A41L, B15R, C6L, or C12L open reading frames (ORFs) enhanced cellular immune responses in recombinant MVA (rMVA) by up to 2-fold. However, previously, we showed that deletion of the C12L, A44L, A46R, B7R, or B15R ORFs from rMVA, using MVA-BAC recombineering technology, did not enhance rMVA immunogenicity at either peak or memory cellular immune responses. Here, we extend our previous study to examine the effect of deleting clusters of genes on rMVA cellular immunogenicity. Two clusters of fifteen genes were deleted in one rMVA mutant that encodes either the 85A antigen of Mycobacterium tuberculosis or an immunodominant H2-Kd-restricted murine malaria epitope (pb9). The deletion mutants were tested in prime only or prime and boost vaccination regimens. The responses showed no improved peak or memory CD8+ T cell frequencies. Our results suggest that the reported small increases in MVA deletion mutants could not be replicated with different antigens, or epitopes. Therefore, the gene deletion strategy may not be taken as a generic approach for improving the immunogenicity of MVA-based vaccines, and should be carefully assessed for every individual recombinant antigen.",

We assessed 20 foliar chemical properties among 12 African savanna woody plant species and their relation to environmental variables (hillslope position, precipitation, geology) and two functional traits (thorn type and seed dispersal mechanism). We found that combinations of six leaf chemical traits (lignin, hemi-cellulose, zinc, boron, magnesium, and manganese) predicted the species with 91% accuracy. Hillslope position, precipitation, and geology accounted for only 12% of the total variance in these six chemical traits. However, thorn type and seed dispersal mechanism accounted for 46% of variance in these chemical traits. The physically defended species had the highest concentrations of hemi-cellulose and boron. Species without physical defense had the highest lignin content if dispersed by vertebrates, but threefold lower lignin content if dispersed by wind. One of the most abundant woody species in southern Africa, Colophospermum mopane, was found to have the highest foliar concentrations of zinc, phosphorus, and \u03b4(13)C, suggesting that zinc chelation may be used by this species to bind metallic toxins and increase uptake of soil phosphorus. Across all studied species, taxonomy and physical traits accounted for the majority of variability in leaf chemistry.",

The nucleoprotein (NP) is the structural component of the vRNP providing a scaffold for the viral RNA. In the vRNP as well as during transcription and replication the viral polymerase interacts with NP but it is unclear which parts of the polymerase and NP mediate these interactions. Previously the C-terminal '627' domain (amino acids 538-693) of PB2 was shown to interact with NP. Here we report that a fragment encompassing amino acids 146-185 of NP is sufficient to mediate this interaction. Using NMR chemical shift perturbation assays we show that amino acid region 601 to 607 of the PB2 '627' domain interacts with this fragment of NP. Substitutions of these PB2 amino acids resulted in diminished RNP activity and surface plasmon resonance assays showed that amino acids D605 was essential for the interaction with NP and V606 may also play a partial role in the interaction. Collectively these results reveal a possible interaction surface between NP and the PB2 subunit of the RNA polymerase complex.",

The experimental data and the results obtained by using relevant mathematical analysis showed that such RA forms of Abs are able to modulate the monoclonal antibody interaction with both soluble and immobilized (to the assay plate well) interferon gamma. These data demonstrated the importance of using relatively low concentrations of both soluble and plate-immobilized interferon gamma to detect the effects of RA forms of Abs to interferon gamma on the binding of monoclonal antibodies to interferon gamma.

            "abstract": "No-take marine protected areas (MPAs) are assumed to enhance fisheries catch via the \"spillover\" effect, where biomass is exported to adjacent exploited areas. Recent studies in spearfishing fisheries suggest that the spillover of gear-na\u00efve individuals from protected to unprotected sites increases catch rates outside the boundaries of MPAs. Whether this is a widespread phenomenon that also holds for other gear types and species is unknown. In this study, we tested if the distance to a Mediterranean MPA predicted the degree of vulnerability to hook and line in four small-bodied coastal fish species. With the assistance of underwater video recording, we investigated the interaction effect of the distance to the boundary of an MPA and species type relative to the latency time to ingest a natural bait, which was considered as a surrogate of fish na\u00efvet\u00e9 or vulnerability to fishing. Vulnerability to angling increased (i.e., latency time decreased) within and near the boundary of an MPA for an intrinsically highly catchable species (Serranus scriba), while it remained constant for an intrinsically uncatchable control species (Chromis chromis). While all of the individuals of S. scriba observed within the MPA and surrounding areas were in essence captured by angling gear, only one fifth of individuals in the far locations were captured. This supports the potential for the spillover of gear-na\u00efve and consequently more vulnerable fish from no-take MPAs. Two other species initially characterized as intermediately catchable (Coris julis and Diplodus annularis) also had a shorter latency time in the vicinity of an MPA, but for these two cases the trend was not statistically significant. Overall, our results suggest that an MPA-induced na\u00efvet\u00e9 effect may not be universal and may be confined to only intrinsically highly catchable fish species. This fact emphasizes the importance of considering the behavioural dimension when predicting the outcomes of MPAs, otherwise the effective contribution may be smaller than predicted for certain highly catchable species such as S. scriba.",

            "abstract": "The aim of the present study was to determine the prevalence and to characterize extended-spectrum \u03b2-lactamases- and\/or carbapenemases-producing Enterobacteriaceae among Enterobacteriaceae isolated from retail chicken meat in Zagazig, Egypt.One hundred and six Enterobacteriaceae isolates were collected from retail chicken meat samples purchased in Zagazig, Egypt in 2013. Species identification was done by MALDI-TOF MS. Screening for ESBL-E was performed by inoculation of isolates recovered from meat samples onto the EbSA (Cepheid Benelux, Apeldoorn, the Netherlands) selective screening agar. ESBL production was confirmed by combination disc diffusion test with clavulanic acid (Rosco, Taastrup, Denmark). Carbapenemases production was confirmed with double disk synergy tests. Resistance genes were characterized by PCR with specific primers for TEM, SHV, and CTX-M and carbapenemases (KPC, NDM, OXA-48, IMP and VIM). PCR products of CTX-M genes were purified and sequenced. Phylogenetic grouping of E. coli was performed by a PCR-based method.Of these 106 isolates 69 (65.09%) were ESBL producers. Twelve (11.32%) of these isolates were also phenotypically class B carbapenemases producer. TEM genes were detected in 61 (57.55%) isolates. 49 (46.23%) isolates harbored CTX-M genes, and 25 (23.58%) carried genes of the SHV family. All CPE belonged to the NDM group. The predominant CTX-M sequence type was CTX-M-15 (89.80%). The majority (80%) of the ESBL-EC belonged to low virulence phylogroups A and B1.This is the first study from Egypt reporting high rates of ESBLs and carbapenemases (65.09% and 11.32%, respectively) in Enterobacteriaceae isolated from retail chicken meat. These results raise serious concerns about public health and food safety as retail meat could serve as a reservoir for these resistant bacteria which could be transferred to humans through the food chain.",

            "abstract": "Faba bean is an important food crop worldwide. However, progress in faba bean genomics lags far behind that of model systems due to limited availability of genetic and genomic information. Using the Illumina platform the faba bean transcriptome from leaves of two lines (29H and Vf136) subjected to Ascochyta fabae infection have been characterized. De novo transcriptome assembly provided a total of 39,185 different transcripts that were functionally annotated, and among these, 13,266 were assigned to gene ontology against Arabidopsis. Quality of the assembly was validated by RT-qPCR amplification of selected transcripts differentially expressed. Comparison of faba bean transcripts with those of better-characterized plant genomes such as Arabidopsis thaliana, Medicago truncatula and Cicer arietinum revealed a sequence similarity of 68.3%, 72.8% and 81.27%, respectively. Moreover, 39,060 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and 3,669 InDels were identified for genotyping applications. Mapping of the sequence reads generated onto the assembled transcripts showed that 393 and 457 transcripts were overexpressed in the resistant (29H) and susceptible genotype (Vf136), respectively. Transcripts involved in plant-pathogen interactions such as leucine rich proteins (LRR) or plant growth regulators involved in plant adaptation to abiotic and biotic stresses were found to be differently expressed in the resistant line. The results reported here represent the most comprehensive transcript database developed so far in faba bean, providing valuable information that could be used to gain insight into the pathways involved in the resistance mechanism against A. fabae and to identify potential resistance genes to be further used in marker assisted selection.",

            "abstract": "To analyze CO2 fluxes under conditions of climate change in an alpine meadow on the central Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, we simulated the effect of warming using open top chambers (OTCs) from 2012 to 2014. The OTCs increased soil temperature by 1.62\u00b0C (P < 0.05), but decreased soil moisture (1.38%, P < 0.05) during the experiments. The response of ecosystem CO2 fluxes to warming was variable, and dependent on the year. Under conditions of warming, mean gross ecosystem productivity (GEP) during the growing season increased significantly in 2012 and 2014 (P < 0.05); however, ecosystem respiration (ER) increased substantially only in 2012 (P < 0.05). The net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) increased marginally in 2012 (P = 0.056), did not change in 2013(P > 0.05), and increased significantly in 2014 (P = 0.034) under conditions of warming. The GEP was more sensitive to climate variations than was the ER, resulting in a large increase in net carbon uptake under warming in the alpine meadow. Under warming, the 3-year averages of GEP, ER, and NEE increased by 19.6%, 15.1%, and 21.1%, respectively. The seasonal dynamic patterns of GEP and NEE, but not ER, were significantly impacted by warming. Aboveground biomass, particularly the graminoid biomass increased significantly under conditions of warming. Soil moisture, soil temperature, and aboveground biomass were the main factors that affected the variation of the ecosystem CO2 fluxes. The effect of warming on inter- and intra-annual patterns of ecosystem CO2 fluxes and the mechanism of different sensitivities in GEP and ER to warming, require further researched.",

            "abstract": "Globally, sodium intake far exceeds the level recommended by the World Health Organization. Assessing health literacy related to salt consumption among older adults could guide the development of interventions that target their knowledge gaps, misconceptions, or poor dietary practices. This study aimed to develop and validate the Chinese Health Literacy Scale for Low Salt Consumption-Hong Kong population (CHLSalt-HK). Based on previous studies on salt intake and nutrition label reading in other countries, we developed similar questions that were appropriate for the Chinese population in Hong Kong. The questions covered the following eight broad areas: functional literacy (term recognition and nutrition label reading), knowledge of the salt content of foods, knowledge of the diseases related to high salt intake, knowledge of international standards, myths about salt intake, attitudes toward salt intake, salty food consumption practices, and nutrition label reading practices. Eight professionals, including doctors, nurses, and dietitians, provided feedback on the scale. The psychometric properties of the scale were assessed based on data collected from a convenience sample of 603 Chinese elderly adults recruited from Elderly Health Centres in Hong Kong. The 49-item CHLSalt-HK had a possible score range of 0 to 98, with a higher score indicating higher health literacy related to salt intake. The CHLSalt-HK had acceptable content validity; the item-level Content Validity Index ranged from 0.857 to 1.000, and the scale-level Content Validity Index was 0.994. Additionally, it had good internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha of 0.799) and good test-retest reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.846). The mean CHLSalt-HK score among those who were aware of the public education slogan about nutrition labels and sodium intake was higher by 3.928 points (95% confidence interval: 1.742 to 6.115) than that among those who were not aware of the slogan, which supports adequate discriminant validity. The validated CHLSalt-HK had acceptable content validity, acceptable construct validity, good internal consistency, good test-retest reliability, and adequate discriminant validity. The scale could be completed in 10-15 minutes and is easy to administer compared with the collection of biomarkers or food diaries. Further research should investigate its concurrent validity and predictive validity. The development of this scale supports the first step in salt intake reduction among older Chinese adults in Hong Kong by enabling the assessment of their health literacy related to salt consumption in health screenings or health assessments, and it can be used to evaluate salt reduction interventions.",

            "abstract": "Plant-targeted pCB302 plasmids containing sequences encoding gfp fusions with a microtubule-binding domain; gfp with the fimbrin actin-binding domain 2; and gfp with AtRACK1C from Arabidopsis thaliana, all harbored in Agrobacterium tumefaciens, were used to assay heterologous expression on three different clades of the photosynthetic dinoflagellate, Symbiodinium. Accessibility to the resistant cell wall and through the plasma membrane of these dinoflagellates was gained after brief but vigorous shaking in the presence of glass beads and polyethylene glycol. A resistance gene to the herbicide Basta allowed appropriate selection of the cells expressing the hybrid proteins, which showed a characteristic green fluorescence, although they appeared to lose their photosynthetic pigments and did not further divide. Cell GFP expression frequency measured as green fluorescence emission yielded 839 per every 106 cells for Symbiodinium kawagutii, followed by 640 and 460 per every 106 cells for Symbiodinium microadriaticum and Symbiodinium sp. Mf11, respectively. Genomic PCR with specific primers amplified the AtRACK1C and gfp sequences after selection in all clades, thus revealing their presence in the cells. RT-PCR from RNA of S. kawagutii co-incubated with A. tumefaciens harboring each of the three vectors with their respective constructs, amplified products corresponding to the heterologous gfp sequence while no products were obtained from three distinct negative controls. The reported procedure shows that mild abrasion followed by co-incubation with A. tumefaciens harboring heterologous plasmids with CaMV35S and nos promoters can lead to expression of the encoded proteins into the Symbiodinium cells in culture. Despite the obvious drawbacks of the procedure, this is an important first step towards a stable transformation of Symbiodinium.",

            "abstract": "The reliability of any quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) experiment can be seriously compromised by variations between samples as well as between PCR runs. This usually result from errors in sample quantification, especially with samples that are obtained from different individuals and tissues and have been collected at various time intervals. Errors also arise from differences in qPCR efficiency between assays performed simultaneously to target multiple genes on the same plate. Consequently, the derived quantitative data for the target genes become distorted. To avoid this grievous error, an endogenous control, with relatively constant transcription levels in the target individual or tissue, is included in the qPCR assay to normalize target gene expression levels in the analysis. Several housekeeping genes (HKGs) have been used as endogenous controls in quantification studies of mRNA transcripts; however, there is no record in the literature of the evaluation of these genes for the tick-borne protozoan parasite, Theileria parva. Importantly, the expression of these genes should be invariable between different T. parva stocks, ideally under different experimental conditions, to gain extensive application in gene expression studies of this parasite. Thus, the expression of several widely used HKGs was evaluated in this study, including the genes encoding \u03b2-actin, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), 28S rRNA, cytochrome b and fructose-2.6-biphosphate aldolase (F6P) proteins. The qPCR analysis revealed that the expression of genes encoding cytochrome b, F6P and GAPDH varied considerably between the two T. parva stocks investigated, the cattle-derived T. parva Muguga and the buffalo-derived T. parva 7014. 28S rRNA and \u03b2-actin gene expression was the most stable; thus, these genes were considered suitable candidates to be used as endogenous control genes for mRNA quantification studies in T. parva.",

            "abstract": "Psychological factors including pain catastrophizing and resilience associate with adjustment and quality of life in people living with chronic pain. Nevertheless, their presentation among females living with HIV and chronic pain has been poorly studied. Given that chronic pain in those living with HIV might occur due to different mechanisms (nociceptive or neuropathic), we hypothesize that the associated psychological states could also differ between these groups. We aimed to compare pain frequency and interference, psychological factors and sleep quality between females living with chronic nociceptive or neuropathic pain. Also, we explored correlations between psychological factors, pain severity and interference in females living with HIV and chronic pain. We performed a cross sectional study assessing females living with HIV and chronic pain, and compared it with a female HIV-positive, pain-free control sample in Brazil. To discriminate the most likely underlying mechanism for the chronic pain, we applied the Leeds Assessment for Neuropathic Signs and Symptoms (LANSS). Forty-nine females living with HIV and chronic pain were assessed, and divided in control (n = 12), nociceptive (n = 10) and neuropathic pain (n = 27) groups. Using validated scales, their pain catastrophizing, resilience, depression, anxiety and sleep disorders were assessed between May 2014 and August 2015. Compared to controls, females living with HIV and neuropathic chronic pain had higher pain frequency (p<0.001), interference on activities (p = 0.002), interference with emotions (p<0.001), catastrophizing (p<0.001), depression (p = 0.015), and lower resilience (p = 0.011). Catastrophizing was also significantly correlated to the burden of chronic pain. The type of chronic pain in females living with HIV should raise concerns regarding significant burden in psychological states in this population (particularly neuropathic pain). Using scales such as the LANSS to identify the type of choric pain, could be of use to address relevant issues for the patients, and to propose tailored therapies.",

            "abstract": "Understanding the space use and movement ecology of apex predators, particularly in mosaic landscapes encompassing different land-uses, is fundamental for formulating effective conservation policy. The top extant big cat in the Middle East and the Caucasus, the Persian leopard Panthera pardus saxicolor, has disappeared from most of its historic range. Its spatial ecology in the areas where it remains is almost unknown. Between September 2014 and May 2017, we collared and monitored six adult leopards (5 males and 1 female) using GPS-satellite Iridium transmitters in Tandoureh National Park (355 km2) along the Iran-Turkmenistan borderland. Using auto-correlated Kernel density estimation based on a continuous-time stochastic process for relocation data, we estimated a mean home range of 103.4 \u00b1 SE 51.8 km2 for resident males which is larger than has been observed in other studies of Asian leopards. Most predation events occurred in core areas, averaging 32.4 \u00b1 SE 12.7 km2. Although neighboring leopards showed high spatiotemporal overlap, their hunting areas were largely exclusive. Five out of six of leopards spent some time outside the national park, among human communities. Our study suggests that a national park can play an 'anchoring' role for individuals of an apex predator that spend some time in the surrounding human-dominated landscapes. Therefore, we envisage that instead of emphasizing either land sharing or land sparing, a combined approach can secure the viability of resilient large carnivores that are able to coexist with humans in the rugged montane landscapes of west and central Asia.",

The aim of this paper was to evaluate the accuracy and recognition level of three-dimensional (3D) computerized forensic craniofacial reconstruction (CCFR) performed in a blind test on open-source software using computed tomography (CT) data from live subjects. Four CCFRs were produced by one of the researchers, who was provided with information concerning the age, sex, and ethnic group of each subject. The CCFRs were produced using Blender\u00ae with 3D models obtained from the CT data and templates from the MakeHuman\u00ae program. The evaluation of accuracy was carried out in CloudCompare, by geometric comparison of the CCFR to the subject 3D face model (obtained from the CT data). A recognition level was performed using the Picasa\u00ae recognition tool with a frontal standardized photography, images of the subject CT face model and the CCFR. Soft-tissue depth and nose, ears and mouth were based on published data, observing Brazilian facial parameters. The results were presented from all the points that form the CCFR model, with an average for each comparison between 63% and 74% with a distance -2.5 \u2264 x \u2264 2.5 mm from the skin surface. The average distances were 1.66 to 0.33 mm and greater distances were observed around the eyes, cheeks, mental and zygomatic regions. Two of the four CCFRs were correctly matched by the Picasa\u00ae tool. Free software programs are capable of producing 3D CCFRs with plausible levels of accuracy and recognition and therefore indicate their value for use in forensic applications.",

RAC allows to simulate the rearing cycle of 4 species, finfish and shellfish, highly important in terms of production in the Mediterranean Sea. The package works both at the scale of the individual and of the farmed population. Mathematical models included in RAC were all validated in previous works, and account for growth and metabolism, based on input data characterizing the forcing functions-water temperature, and food quality\/quantity. The package provides a demo dataset of forcings for each species, as well as a typical set of husbandry parameters for Mediterranean conditions. The present work illustrates RAC main features, and its current capabilities\/limitations. Three test cases are presented as a proof of concept of RAC applicability, and to demonstrate its potential for integrating different open products nowadays provided by remote sensing and operational oceanography.",

            "abstract": "Phototrophs underpin most ecosystem processes, but to do this they need sufficient light. This critical resource, however, is compromised along many marine shores by increased loads of sediments and nutrients from degraded inland habitats. Increased attenuation of total irradiance within coastal water columns due to turbidity is known to reduce species' depth limits and affect the taxonomic structure and architecture of algal-dominated assemblages, but virtually no attention has been paid to the potential for changes in spectral quality of light energy to impact production dynamics. Pioneering studies over 70 years ago showed how different pigmentation of red, green and brown algae affected absorption spectra, action spectra, and photosynthetic efficiency across the PAR (photosynthetically active radiation) spectrum. Little of this, however, has found its way into ecological syntheses of the impacts of optically active contaminants on coastal macroalgal communities. Here we test the ability of macroalgal assemblages composed of multiple functional groups (including representatives from the chlorophyta, rhodophyta and phaeophyta) to use the total light resource, including different light wavelengths and examine the effects of suspended sediments on the penetration and spectral quality of light in coastal waters. We show that assemblages composed of multiple functional groups are better able to use light throughout the PAR spectrum. Macroalgal assemblages with four sub-canopy species were between 50-75% more productive than assemblages with only one or two sub-canopy species. Furthermore, attenuation of the PAR spectrum showed both a loss of quanta and a shift in spectral distribution with depth across coastal waters of different clarity, with consequences to productivity dynamics of diverse layered assemblages. The processes of light complementarity may help provide a mechanistic understanding of how altered turbidity affects macroalgal assemblages in coastal waters, which are increasingly threatened by diminishing light quantity and altered spectral distributions through sedimentation and eutrophication.",

            "abstract": "Hemispherical photography is a well-established method to optically assess ecological parameters related to plant canopies; e.g. ground-level light regimes and the distribution of foliage within the crown space. Interpreting hemispherical photographs involves classifying pixels as either sky or vegetation. A wide range of automatic thresholding or binarization algorithms exists to classify the photographs. The variety in methodology hampers ability to compare results across studies. To identify an optimal threshold selection method, this study assessed the accuracy of seven binarization methods implemented in software currently available for the processing of hemispherical photographs. Therefore, binarizations obtained by the algorithms were compared to reference data generated through a manual binarization of a stratified random selection of pixels. This approach was adopted from the accuracy assessment of map classifications known from remote sensing studies. Percentage correct (Pc) and kappa-statistics (K) were calculated. The accuracy of the algorithms was assessed for photographs taken with automatic exposure settings (auto-exposure) and photographs taken with settings which avoid overexposure (histogram-exposure). In addition, gap fraction values derived from hemispherical photographs were compared with estimates derived from the manually classified reference pixels. All tested algorithms were shown to be sensitive to overexposure. Three of the algorithms showed an accuracy which was high enough to be recommended for the processing of histogram-exposed hemispherical photographs: \"Minimum\" (Pc 98.8%; K 0.952), \"Edge Detection\" (Pc 98.1%; K 0.950), and \"Minimum Histogram\" (Pc 98.1%; K 0.947). The Minimum algorithm overestimated gap fraction least of all (11%). The overestimation by the algorithms Edge Detection (63%) and Minimum Histogram (67%) were considerably larger. For the remaining four evaluated algorithms (IsoData, Maximum Entropy, MinError, and Otsu) an incompatibility with photographs containing overexposed pixels was detected. When applied to histogram-exposed photographs, these algorithms overestimated the gap fraction by at least 180%.",

            "abstract": "The scientific enterprise depends critically on the preservation of and open access to published data. This basic tenet applies acutely to phylogenies (estimates of evolutionary relationships among species). Increasingly, phylogenies are estimated from increasingly large, genome-scale datasets using increasingly complex statistical methods that require increasing levels of expertise and computational investment. Moreover, the resulting phylogenetic data provide an explicit historical perspective that critically informs research in a vast and growing number of scientific disciplines. One such use is the study of changes in rates of lineage diversification (speciation--extinction) through time. As part of a meta-analysis in this area, we sought to collect phylogenetic data (comprising nucleotide sequence alignment and tree files) from 217 studies published in 46 journals over a 13-year period. We document our attempts to procure those data (from online archives and by direct request to corresponding authors), and report results of analyses (using Bayesian logistic regression) to assess the impact of various factors on the success of our efforts. Overall, complete phylogenetic data for [Formula: see text] of these studies are effectively lost to science. Our study indicates that phylogenetic data are more likely to be deposited in online archives and\/or shared upon request when: (1) the publishing journal has a strong data-sharing policy; (2) the publishing journal has a higher impact factor, and; (3) the data are requested from faculty rather than students. Importantly, our survey spans recent policy initiatives and infrastructural changes; our analyses indicate that the positive impact of these community initiatives has been both dramatic and immediate. Although the results of our study indicate that the situation is dire, our findings also reveal tremendous recent progress in the sharing and preservation of phylogenetic data.",

            "abstract": "We aimed to evaluate the association between statin use and cognitive function. Cognitive function was measured with the Ruff Figural Fluency Test (RFFT; worst score, 0; best score, 175 points) and the Visual Association Test (VAT; low performance, 0-10; high performance, 11-12 points) in an observational study that included 4,095 community-dwelling participants aged 35-82 years. Data on statin use were obtained from a computerized pharmacy database. Analysis were done for the total cohort and subsamples matched on cardiovascular risk (N = 1232) or propensity score for statin use (N = 3609). We found that a total of 904 participants (10%) used a statin. Statin users were older than non-users: mean age (SD) 61 (10) vs. 52 (11) years (p < 0.001). The median duration of statin use was 3.8 (interquartile range, 1.6-4.5) years. Unadjusted, statin users had worse cognitive performance than non-users. The mean RFFT score (SD) in statin users and non-users was 58 (23) and 72 (26) points, respectively (p < 0.001). VAT performance was high in 261 (29%) statin users and 1351 (43%) non-users (p < 0.001). However, multiple regression analysis did not show a significant association of RFFT score with statin use (B, -0.82; 95%CI, -2.77 to 1.14; p = 0.41) nor with statin solubility, statin dose or duration of statin use. Statin users with high doses or long-term use had similar cognitive performance as non-users. This was found in persons with low as well as high cardiovascular risk, and in younger as well as older subjects. Also, the mean RFFT score per quintile of propensity score for statin use was comparable for statin users and non-users. Similar results were found for the VAT score as outcome measure. In conclusion, statin use was not associated with cognitive function. This was independent of statin dose or duration of statin use.",

            "abstract": "Atherosclerosis is a chronic and systemic disease and its developmental process involves the synergism of multiple risk factors such as hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes, obesity and smoking. The diagnosis of subclinical atherosclerosis is essential for strategic guidance towards suitable treatments and efficient prevention against acute cardiovascular events. This study employed ultrasound radiofrequency (RF) tracking technology to characterize human carotid arteries in vivo in terms of intima-media thickness (IMT) and artery stiffness, and evaluated the statistical correlation between carotid IMT and stiffness, and the number of risk factors for atherosclerosis.A total of 160 asymptomatic subjects were enrolled. Ultrasound RF-tracking technology was employed to acquire carotid IMT and stiffness parameters: maximum IMT ((MAX)IMT), RF Quality IMT ((RF)QIMT), distensibility coefficient (DC), compliance coefficient (CC), \u03b1index, \u03b2 index and local pulse wave velocity (PWV\u03b2). The subjects were categorized in four groups in terms of the number of risk factors: 'zero', 'single', 'double', and 'multiple', and statistical analyses of carotid IMT and stiffness parameters were performed between these different groups.The subjects (n = 145) with (MAX)IMT smaller than 1.0 mm matched the IMT criteria for non-atherosclerosis and were named as NA-subjects. Spearman's rho correlation analysis of the whole group and the NA-subjects both showed that (MAX)IMT correlated positively with (RF)QIMT, \u03b1, \u03b2, and PWV\u03b2, and negatively with DC and CC (p<0.01). The analysis of covariance of NA-subjects showed significant differences between subjects with and without risk factors, and also showed significant differences between the 'zero', 'single', 'double', and 'multiple' groups.The carotid IMT and stiffness parameters obtained by the ultrasound RF-tracking technology were demonstrated to possess significant statistical correlation with the number of risk factors from 160 subjects, and these anatomical and mechanical parameters may potentially be used together with the IMT criteria to support subclinical atherosclerosis diagnosis.",

While several studies suggest the importance of this mechanism, there is still little information of how the variance of negative density dependence (NDD) affects diversity of forest communities. With computer simulations, we analyzed the impact of strength and variance of NDD within tree communities on species diversity. We show that stronger NDD leads to higher species diversity. Furthermore, lower range of strengths of NDD within a community increases species richness and decreases variance of species abundances. Our results show that, beyond the average strength of NDD, the variance of NDD is also crucially important to explain species diversity. This can explain the dissimilarity of biodiversity between tropical and temperate forest: highly diverse forests could have lower NDD variance. This report suggests that natural enemies and the variety of the magnitude of their effects can contribute to the maintenance of biodiversity.",

            "abstract": "A recent trial unexpectedly reported that atrial fibrillation, when defined as serious, occurred more often in participants randomized to an annual infusion of the relatively new parenteral bisphosphonate, zoledronic acid, than among those given placebo, but had limited power. Two subsequent population-based case-control studies of patients receiving a more established oral bisphosphonate, alendronic acid, reported conflicting results, possibly due to uncontrolled confounding factors.We used the United Kingdom General Practice Research Database to assess the risk of atrial fibrillation and flutter in women exposed to the oral bisphosphonates, alendronic acid and risedronate sodium. The self-controlled case-series method was used to minimise the potential for confounding. The age-adjusted incidence rate ratio for atrial fibrillation or flutter in individuals during their exposure to these oral bisphosphonates (n = 2195) was 1.07 (95% CI 0.94-1.21). The age-adjusted incidence rate ratio for alendronic acid (n = 1489) and risedronate sodium (n = 649) exposed individuals were 1.09 (95% CI 0.93-1.26) and 0.99 (95% CI 0.78-1.26) respectively. In post-hoc analyses, an increased risk of incident atrial fibrillation or flutter was detected for patients during their first few months of alendronic acid therapy.We found no robust evidence of an overall long-term increased risk of atrial fibrillation or flutter associated with continued exposure to the oral bisphosphonates, alendronic acid and risedronate sodium. A possible signal for an increase in risk during the first few months of therapy with alendronic acid needs to be re-assessed in additional studies.",

            "abstract": "Autism is a complex childhood neurodevelopmental disorder with a strong genetic basis. Microdeletion or duplication of a approximately 500-700-kb genomic rearrangement on 16p11.2 that contains 24 genes represents the second most frequent chromosomal disorder associated with autism. The role of common and rare 16p11.2 sequence variants in autism etiology is unknown.To identify common 16p11.2 variants with a potential role in autism, we performed association studies using existing data generated from three microarray platforms: Affymetrix 5.0 (777 families), Illumina 550 K (943 families), and Affymetrix 500 K (60 families). No common variants were identified that were significantly associated with autism. To look for rare variants, we performed resequencing of coding and promoter regions for eight candidate genes selected based on their known expression patterns and functions. In total, we identified 26 novel variants in autism: 13 exonic (nine non-synonymous, three synonymous, and one untranslated region) and 13 promoter variants. We found a significant association between autism and a coding variant in the seizure-related gene SEZ6L2 (12\/1106 autism vs. 3\/1161 controls; p = 0.018). Sez6l2 expression in mouse embryos was restricted to the spinal cord and brain. SEZ6L2 expression in human fetal brain was highest in post-mitotic cortical layers, hippocampus, amygdala, and thalamus. Association analysis of SEZ6L2 in an independent sample set failed to replicate our initial findings.We have identified sequence variation in at least one candidate gene in 16p11.2 that may represent a novel genetic risk factor for autism. However, further studies are required to substantiate these preliminary findings.",

            "title": "Identification of major factors influencing ELISpot-based monitoring of cellular responses to antigens from Mycobacterium tuberculosis.",
            "abstract": "A number of different interferon-gamma ELISpot protocols are in use in laboratories studying antigen-specific immune responses. It is therefore unclear how results from different assays compare, and what factors most significantly influence assay outcome. One such difference is that some laboratories use a short in vitro stimulation period of cells before they are transferred to the ELISpot plate; this is commonly done in the case of frozen cells, in order to enhance assay sensitivity. Other differences that may be significant include antibody coating of plates, the use of media with or without serum, the serum source and the number of cells added to the wells. The aim of this paper was to identify which components of the different ELISpot protocols influenced assay sensitivity and inter-laboratory variation. Four laboratories provided protocols for quantifying numbers of interferon-gamma spot forming cells in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells stimulated with Mycobacterium tuberculosis derived antigens. The differences in the protocols were compared directly. We found that several sources of variation in assay protocols can be eliminated, for example by avoiding serum supplementation and using AIM-V serum free medium. In addition, the number of cells added to ELISpot wells should also be standardised. Importantly, delays in peripheral blood mononuclear cell processing before stimulation had a marked effect on the number of detectable spot forming cells; processing delay thus should be minimised as well as standardised. Finally, a pre-stimulation culture period improved the sensitivity of the assay, however this effect may be both antigen and donor dependent. In conclusion, small differences in ELISpot protocols in routine use can affect the results obtained and care should be given to conditions selected for use in a given study. A pre-stimulation step may improve the sensitivity of the assay, particularly when cells have been previously frozen.",

            "abstract": "Difficulties with inducing sterile and long lasting protective immunity against malaria with subunit vaccines has renewed interest in vaccinations with attenuated Plasmodium parasites. Immunizations with sporozoites that are attenuated by radiation (RAS) can induce strong protective immunity both in humans and rodent models of malaria. Recently, in rodent parasites it has been shown that through the deletion of a single gene, sporozoites can also become attenuated in liver stage development and, importantly, immunization with these sporozoites results in immune responses identical to RAS. The promise of vaccination using these genetically attenuated sporozoites (GAS) depends on translating the results in rodent malaria models to human malaria. In this study, we perform the first essential step in this transition by disrupting, p52, in P. falciparum an ortholog of the rodent parasite gene, p36p, which we had previously shown can confer long lasting protective immunity in mice. These P. falciparum P52 deficient sporozoites demonstrate gliding motility, cell traversal and an invasion rate into primary human hepatocytes in vitro that is comparable to wild type sporozoites. However, inside the host hepatocyte development is arrested very soon after invasion. This study reveals, for the first time, that disrupting the equivalent gene in both P. falciparum and rodent malaria Plasmodium species generates parasites that become similarly arrested during liver stage development and these results pave the way for further development of GAS for human use.",

            "abstract": "DNA synthesis during replication relies on RNA primers synthesised by the primase, a specialised DNA-dependent RNA polymerase that can initiate nucleic acid synthesis de novo. In archaeal and eukaryotic organisms, the primase is a heterodimeric enzyme resulting from the constitutive association of a small (PriS) and large (PriL) subunit. The ability of the primase to initiate synthesis of an RNA primer depends on a conserved Fe-S domain at the C-terminus of PriL (PriL-CTD). However, the critical role of the PriL-CTD in the catalytic mechanism of initiation is not understood.Here we report the crystal structure of the yeast PriL-CTD at 1.55 A resolution. The structure reveals that the PriL-CTD folds in two largely independent alpha-helical domains joined at their interface by a [4Fe-4S] cluster. The larger N-terminal domain represents the most conserved portion of the PriL-CTD, whereas the smaller C-terminal domain is largely absent in archaeal PriL. Unexpectedly, the N-terminal domain reveals a striking structural similarity with the active site region of the DNA photolyase\/cryptochrome family of flavoproteins. The region of similarity includes PriL-CTD residues that are known to be essential for initiation of RNA primer synthesis by the primase.Our study reports the first crystallographic model of the conserved Fe-S domain of the archaeal\/eukaryotic primase. The structural comparison with a cryptochrome protein bound to flavin adenine dinucleotide and single-stranded DNA provides important insight into the mechanism of RNA primer synthesis by the primase.",

However, the evolutionary forces that lead to the accumulation of such incompatibilities between diverging taxa are poorly understood. Segregation distorters are believed to be an important source of Dobzhansky-Muller incompatibilities between hybridizing species of Drosophila as well as hybridizing crop plants, but it remains unclear if these selfish genetic elements contribute to reproductive isolation in other taxa. Here, we collected viable sperm from first-generation hybrid male progeny of Mus musculus castaneus and M. m. domesticus, two subspecies of rodent in the earliest stages of speciation. We then genotyped millions of single nucleotide polymorphisms in these gamete pools and tested for a skew in the frequency of parental alleles across the genome. We show that segregation distorters are not measurable contributors to observed infertility in these hybrid males, despite sufficient statistical power to detect even weak segregation distortion with our novel method. Thus, reduced hybrid male fertility in crosses between these nascent species is attributable to other evolutionary forces.",

Reasons for low levels of PA have not previously been explored among Asians living within their endogenous environment. This qualitative study was performed to explore the contextual reasons that limited PA among type 2 diabetic patients living in a rural community.Purposeful sampling recruited 40 participants with long standing type 2 diabetes for this qualitative study. Semi-structered questions utilising in-depth interviews were used to collect data on PA patterns, barriers to PA and factors that would facilitate PA. The interviews were digitally recorded and transcribed. Data were analyzed using a framework approach.The sample consisted of 11 males and 29 females. Mean age was 55.4 (SD 8.9) years. The mean duration of diabetes in the study population was 8.5 (SD 6.8) years. Inability to differentitate household and daily activities from PA emerged as a recurring theme. Most did not have a clear understanding of the type or duration of PA that they should perform. Health related issues, lifestyle and time management, envronmental and social factors like social embarrassment, prioritizing household activities over PA were important factors that limited PA. Most stated that the concept of exercising was alien to their culture and lifestyle.Culturally appropriate programmes that strengthen health education and empower communities to overcome socio-economic barriers that limit PA should be implemented to better manage diabetes among rural Sri Lankan diabetic patients.",

To date, research on basal cortisol activity and social development in childhood and adolescence has predominately focused on understanding maladjustment and dysfunction in development. The degree to which basal cortisol is also involved in positive adjustment and social functioning remains largely unexplored. A total of 154 early adolescents (46% female; Mean age = 11.26; SD = .65) from diverse ethnic backgrounds provided self-reports of perspective taking, peer reports of acceptance by classmates, peer reports of prosocial behaviors, and saliva samples to assess basal cortisol. As expected and in alignment with previous research, afternoon cortisol, perspective taking, prosocial behaviors, and peer acceptance were all positively correlated. Path analyses followed by bootstrapping analyses revealed that the direct path from higher afternoon cortisol to higher levels of prosocial behavior was fully mediated by perspective taking skills. The direct path from higher afternoon cortisol to peer acceptance was fully mediated by perspective taking skills and prosocial behavior. The findings are discussed within the broader context of previous research on cortisol and social adjustment in childhood and early adolescence. The practical relevance of the findings is considered.",

            "abstract": "Akinetic mutism is a key diagnostic feature of prion diseases, however, their rapidly progressive nature makes detailed investigation of the language disorder in a large cohort extremely challenging. This study aims to position prion diseases in the nosology of language disorders and improve early clinical recognition.A systematic, prospective investigation of language disorders in a large cohort of patients diagnosed with prion diseases. 568 patients were included as a sub-study of the National Prion Monitoring Cohort. All patients had at least one assessment with the MRC Scale, a milestone-based functional scale with language and non-language components. Forty patients, with early symptoms and able to travel to the study site, were also administered a comprehensive battery of language tests (spontaneous speech, semantics, syntax, repetition, naming, comprehension and lexical retrieval under different conditions).5\/568 (0.9%) patients presented with leading language symptoms. Those with repeated measurements deteriorated at a slower rate in language compared to non-language milestones. Amongst the subgroup of 40 patients who underwent detailed language testing, only three tasks-semantic and phonemic fluency and sentence comprehension-were particularly vulnerable early in the disease. These tasks were highly correlated with performance on non-verbal executive tests. Patients were also impaired on a test of dynamic aphasia.These results provide evidence that the language disorder in prion disease is rarely an isolated clinical or cognitive feature. The language abnormality is indicative of a dynamic aphasia in the context of a prominent dysexecutive syndrome, similar to that seen in patients with the degenerative movement disorder progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP).",

            "abstract": "Despite their importance in nano-environmental health and safety, interactions between engineered nanomaterials and microbial life remain poorly characterized. Here, we used the model organism E. coli to study the penetration requirements, subcellular localization, induction of stress responses, and long-term fate of luminescent Mn-doped ZnS nanocrystals fabricated under \"green\" processing conditions with a minimized ZnS-binding protein. We find that such protein-coated quantum dots (QDs) are unable to penetrate the envelope of unmodified E. coli but readily translocate to the cytoplasm of cells that have been made competent by chemical treatment. The process is dose-dependent and reminiscent of bacterial transformation. Cells that have internalized up to 0.5 \u03bcg\/mL of nanocrystals do not experience a significant activation of the unfolded protein or SOS responses but undergo oxidative stress when exposed to high QD doses (2.5 \u03bcg\/mL). Finally, although they are stable in quiescent cells over temperatures ranging from 4 to 42\u00b0C, internalized QDs are rapidly diluted by cell division in a process that does not involve TolC-dependent efflux. Taken together, our results suggest that biomimetic QDs based on low toxicity inorganic cores capped by a protein shell are unlikely to cause significant damage to the microbial ecosystem.",

This study investigated whether, when compared to low socially anxious individuals, high socially anxious individuals overestimate the proportion of people in a crowd who are observing them. It was hypothesized that any potential overestimation would be modulated by self-focused attention.Forty-eight high and 48 low socially anxious participants performed a \"faces in a crowd\" computer task during which they briefly saw matrices of faces, which varied in terms of the proportion of people who were looking at them. Participants estimated the proportion of people who were looking at them. The task was performed once with mirrors present (to induce an enhanced self-focused state) and once without mirrors present (neutral state).Participants' subjective estimates and the objective proportion of faces looking towards them were strongly correlated in both the high and low socially anxious groups. However, high socially anxious participants estimated that more people were looking at them than low socially anxious participants. In the first phase of the experiment, but not in the later phases, this effect was magnified in the mirror condition.This study provides preliminary evidence of a social anxiety related perceptual difference that may be amplified by self-focused attention. Clinical implications are discussed.",

Genotyping was done with Illumina Omni2.5 array and imputation using 1000 Genomes Phase I release data. Association with HbF was analysed using a linear mixed model to control for complex population structure within our study. We successfully replicated known associations for HbF near BCL11A and the HBS1L-MYB intergenic polymorphisms (HMIP), including multiple independent effects near BCL11A, consistent with previous reports. We observed eight additional associations with P<10(-6). These associations could not be replicated in a SCA population in the UK.This is the largest GWAS study in SCA in Africa. We have confirmed known associations and identified new genetic associations with HbF that require further replication in SCA populations in Africa.",

            "abstract": "Observational studies have generated conflicting evidence on the effects of moderate maternal alcohol consumption during pregnancy on offspring cognition mainly reflecting problems of confounding. Among mothers who drink during pregnancy fetal alcohol exposure is influenced not only by mother's intake but also by genetic variants carried by both the mother and the fetus. Associations between children's cognitive function and both maternal and child genotype at these loci can shed light on the effects of maternal alcohol consumption on offspring cognitive development.We used a large population based study of women recruited during pregnancy to determine whether genetic variants in alcohol metabolising genes in this cohort of women and their children were related to the child's cognitive score (measured by the Weschler Intelligence Scale) at age 8.We found that four genetic variants in alcohol metabolising genes in 4167 children were strongly related to lower IQ at age 8, as was a risk allele score based on these 4 variants. This effect was only seen amongst the offspring of mothers who were moderate drinkers (1-6 units alcohol per week during pregnancy (per allele effect estimates were -1.80 (95% CI=\u200a-2.63 to -0.97) p=0.00002, with no effect among children whose mothers abstained during pregnancy (0.16 (95%CI=\u200a-1.05 to 1.36) p=0.80), p-value for interaction \u200a=0.009). A further genetic variant associated with alcohol metabolism in mothers was associated with their child's IQ, but again only among mothers who drank during pregnancy.",

            "abstract": "Hypertension and excess body weight are major risk factors of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in developing countries. In countries with a high HIV prevalence, it is unknown how increased antiretroviral treatment and care (ART) coverage has affected the prevalence of overweight, obesity, and hypertension. We conducted a health survey in 2010 based on the WHO STEPwise approach in 14,198 adult resident participants of a demographic surveillance area in rural South Africa to investigate factors associated with hypertension and excess weight including HIV infection and ART status. Women had a significantly higher median body mass index (BMI) than men (26.4 vs. 21.2 kg\/m(2), p<0.001). The prevalence of obesity (BMI \u2265 30 kg\/m(2)) in women (31.3%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 30.2-32.4) was 6.5 times higher than in men (4.9%, 95% CI 4.1-5.7), whereas prevalence of hypertension (systolic or diastolic blood pressure \u2265 140 or 90 mm Hg, respectively) was 1.4 times higher in women than in men (28.5% vs 20.8%, p<0.001). In multivariable regression analysis, both hypertension and obesity were significantly associated with sex, age, HIV and ART status. The BMI of women and men on ART was on average 3.8 (95% CI 3.2-3.8) and 1.7 (95% CI 0.9-2.5) kg\/m(2) lower than of HIV-negative women and men, respectively. The BMI of HIV-infected women and men not on ART was on average 1.2 (95% CI 0.8-1.6) and 0.4 (95% CI -0.1-0.9) kg\/m(2) lower than of HIV-negative women and men, respectively. Obesity was a bigger risk factor for hypertension in men (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 2.99, 95% CI 2.00-4.48) than in women (aOR 1.64, 95% CI 1.39-1.92) and overweight (25 \u2264 BMI<30) was a significant risk factor for men only (aOR 1.53 95% CI 1.14-2.06). Our study suggests that, cardiovascular risk factors of hypertension and obesity differ substantially between women and men in rural South Africa.",

Here, we used a syngeneic, orthotopic mouse model of breast cancer to study mechanisms of wound-promoted tumor growth. Our results demonstrate that exposure of metastatic mouse breast cancer cells (4T1) to SDF-1\u03b1, which is increased in wound fluid, results in increased tumor growth. Both, wounding and exposure of 4T1 cells to SDF-1\u03b1 not only increased tumor growth, but also tumor cell proliferation rate and stromal collagen deposition. Conversely, systemic inhibition of SDF-1\u03b1 signaling with the small molecule AMD 3100 abolished the effect of wounding, and decreased cell proliferation, collagen deposition, and neoangiogenesis to the levels observed in control animals. Furthermore, using different mouse strains we could demonstrate that the effect of wounding on tumor growth and SDF-1\u03b1 levels is host dependent and varies between mouse strains. Our results show that wound-promoted tumor growth is mediated by elevated SDF-1\u03b1 levels and indicate that the effect of acute wounds on tumor growth depends on the predetermined wound response of the host background and its predetermined wound response.",

            "abstract": "Sleep plays a pivotal role in normal biological functions. Sleep loss results in higher stress vulnerability and is often found in mental disorders. There is evidence that brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) could be a central player in this relationship. Recently, we could demonstrate that subjects suffering from current symptoms of insomnia exhibited significantly decreased serum BDNF levels compared with sleep-healthy controls. In accordance with the paradigm indicating a link between sleep and BDNF, we aimed to investigate if the stress system influences the association between sleep and BDNF.Participants with current symptoms of insomnia plus a former diagnosis of Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS) and\/or Periodic Limb Movement (PLM) and sleep healthy controls were included in the study. They completed questionnaires on sleep (ISI, Insomnia Severity Index) and stress (PSS, Perceived Stress Scale) and provided a blood sample for determination of serum BDNF. We found a significant interaction between stress and insomnia with an impact on serum BDNF levels. Moreover, insomnia severity groups and score on the PSS each revealed a significant main effect on serum BDNF levels. Insomnia severity was associated with increased stress experience affecting serum BDNF levels. Of note, the association between stress and BDNF was only observed in subjects without insomnia. Using a mediation model, sleep was revealed as a mediator of the association between stress experience and serum BDNF levels.This is the first study to show that the interplay between stress and sleep impacts BDNF levels, suggesting an important role of this relationship in the pathogenesis of stress-associated mental disorders. Hence, we suggest sleep as a key mediator at the connection between stress and BDNF. Whether sleep is maintained or disturbed might explain why some individuals are able to handle a certain stress load while others develop a mental disorder.",

            "abstract": "Increasing evidence suggests that chromosomal regions containing microRNAs are functionally important in cancers. Here, we show that genomic loci encoding miR-204 are frequently lost in multiple cancers, including ovarian cancers, pediatric renal tumors, and breast cancers. MiR-204 shows drastically reduced expression in several cancers and acts as a potent tumor suppressor, inhibiting tumor metastasis in vivo when systemically delivered. We demonstrated that miR-204 exerts its function by targeting genes involved in tumorigenesis including brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), a neurotrophin family member which is known to promote tumor angiogenesis and invasiveness. Analysis of primary tumors shows that increased expression of BDNF or its receptor tropomyosin-related kinase B (TrkB) parallel a markedly reduced expression of miR-204. Our results reveal that loss of miR-204 results in BDNF overexpression and subsequent activation of the small GTPase Rac1 and actin reorganization through the AKT\/mTOR signaling pathway leading to cancer cell migration and invasion. These results suggest that microdeletion of genomic loci containing miR-204 is directly linked with the deregulation of key oncogenic pathways that provide crucial stimulus for tumor growth and metastasis. Our findings provide a strong rationale for manipulating miR-204 levels therapeutically to suppress tumor metastasis.",

            "abstract": "Mifepristone (RU486), a potent antagonist of progesterone and glucocorticoids, is involved in immune regulation. Our previous studies demonstrated that mifepristone directly augments the cytotoxicity of human uterine natural killer (uNK) cells. However, the mechanism responsible for this increase in cytotoxicity is not known. Here, we explored whether the increased cytotoxicity in uNK cells produced by mifepristone is due to either anti-progesterone or anti-glucocorticoid activity, and also investigated relevant changes in the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway.Uterine NK cells were isolated from decidual samples and incubated with different concentrations of progesterone, cortisol, or mifepristone. The cytotoxicity and perforin expression of uNK cells were detected by mitochondrial lactate dehydrogenase-based MTS staining and flow cytometry assays, respectively. Phosphorylation of components of the MAPK signaling pathway was detected by Western blot. Cortisol attenuated uNK cell-mediated cytotoxicity in a concentration-dependent manner whereas progesterone had no effect. Mifepristone alone increased the cytotoxicity and perforin expression of uNK cells; these effects were blocked by cortisol. Furthermore, mifepristone increased the phosphorylation of ERK1\/2 in a cortisol-reversible manner. Specific ERK1\/2 inhibitor PD98059 or U0126 blocked cortisol- and mifepristone-induced responses in uNK cells.These results suggest that mifepristone acts as a glucocorticoid antagonist to augment uNK cell-mediated cytotoxicity via ERK activation, which may be caused by increased perforin expression. These observations may reveal an important mechanism by which mifepristone upregulates the cytotoxicity of uNK cells.",

            "abstract": "In acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients, the bone marrow niche is widely known to be an important element of treatment response and relapse. Furthermore, a characteristic liver pathology observed in ALL patients implies that the hepatic microenvironment provides an extramedullary niche for leukemic cells. However, it remains unclear whether the liver actually provides a specific niche. The mechanism underlying this pathology is also poorly understood. Here, to answer these questions, we reconstituted the histopathology of leukemic liver by using patients-derived primary ALL cells into NOD\/SCID\/Yc (null) mice. The liver pathology in this model was similar to that observed in the patients. By using this model, we clearly demonstrated that bile duct epithelial cells form a hepatic niche that supports infiltration and proliferation of ALL cells in the liver. Furthermore, we showed that functions of the niche are maintained by the SDF-1\/CXCR4 axis, proposing a novel therapeutic approach targeting the extramedullary niche by inhibition of the SDF-1\/CXCR4 axis. In conclusion, we demonstrated that the liver dissemination of leukemia is not due to nonselective infiltration, but rather systematic invasion and proliferation of leukemic cells in hepatic niche. Although the contribution of SDF-1\/CXCR4 axis is reported in some cancer cells or leukemic niches such as bone marrow, we demonstrated that this axis works even in the extramedullary niche of leukemic cells. Our findings form the basis for therapeutic approaches that target the extramedullary niche by inhibiting the SDF-1\/CXCR4 axis.",

            "abstract": "The pathogenesis of interstitial cystitis\/painful bladder syndrome (IC\/PBS) is multifactorial, but likely involves urothelial cell dysfunction and mast cell accumulation in the bladder wall. Activated mast cells in the bladder wall release several inflammatory mediators, including histamine and tryptase. We determined whether mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases are activated in response to tryptase stimulation of urothelial cells derived from human normal and IC\/PBS bladders. Tryptase stimulation of normal urothelial cells resulted in a 2.5-fold increase in extracellular signal regulated kinase 1\/2 (ERK 1\/2). A 5.5-fold increase in ERK 1\/2 activity was observed in urothelial cells isolated from IC\/PBS bladders. No significant change in p38 MAP kinase was observed in tryptase-stimulated normal urothelial cells but a 2.5-fold increase was observed in cells isolated from IC\/PBS bladders. Inhibition of ERK 1\/2 with PD98059 or inhibition of p38 MAP kinase with SB203580 did not block tryptase-stimulated iPLA2 activation. Incubation with the membrane phospholipid-derived PLA2 hydrolysis product lysoplasmenylcholine increased ERK 1\/2 activity, suggesting the iPLA2 activation is upstream of ERK 1\/2. Real time measurements of impedance to evaluate wound healing of cell cultures indicated increased healing rates in normal and IC\/PBS urothelial cells in the presence of tryptase, with inhibition of ERK 1\/2 significantly decreasing the wound healing rate of IC\/PBS urothelium. We conclude that activation of ERK 1\/2 in response to tryptase stimulation may facilitate wound healing or cell motility in areas of inflammation in the bladder associated with IC\/PBS.",

            "abstract": "Gene-level analysis of ImmunoChip or genome-wide association studies (GWAS) data has not been previously reported for systemic sclerosis (SSc, scleroderma). The objective of this study was to analyze genetic susceptibility loci in SSc at the gene level and to determine if the detected associations were shared in African-American and White populations, using data from ImmunoChip and GWAS genotyping studies. The White sample included 1833 cases and 3466 controls (956 cases and 2741 controls from the US and 877 cases and 725 controls from Spain) and the African American sample, 291 cases and 260 controls. In both Whites and African Americans, we performed a gene-level analysis that integrates association statistics in a gene possibly harboring multiple SNPs with weak effect on disease risk, using Versatile Gene-based Association Study (VEGAS) software. The SNP-level analysis was performed using PLINK v.1.07. We identified 4 novel candidate genes (STAT1, FCGR2C, NIPSNAP3B, and SCT) significantly associated and 4 genes (SERBP1, PINX1, TMEM175 and EXOC2) suggestively associated with SSc in the gene level analysis in White patients. As an exploratory analysis we compared the results on Whites with those from African Americans. Of previously established susceptibility genes identified in Whites, only TNFAIP3 was significant at the nominal level (p = 6.13x10-3) in African Americans in the gene-level analysis of the ImmunoChip data. Among the top suggestive novel genes identified in Whites based on the ImmunoChip data, FCGR2C and PINX1 were only nominally significant in African Americans (p = 0.016 and p = 0.028, respectively), while among the top novel genes identified in the gene-level analysis in African Americans, UNC5C (p = 5.57x10-4) and CLEC16A (p = 0.0463) were also nominally significant in Whites. We also present the gene-level analysis of SSc clinical and autoantibody phenotypes among Whites. Our findings need to be validated by independent studies, particularly due to the limited sample size of African Americans.",

            "abstract": "Machine learning is becoming a popular and important approach in the field of medical research. In this study, we investigate the relative performance of various machine learning methods such as Decision Tree, Na\u00efve Bayes, Logistic Regression, Logistic Model Tree and Random Forests for predicting incident diabetes using medical records of cardiorespiratory fitness. In addition, we apply different techniques to uncover potential predictors of diabetes. This FIT project study used data of 32,555 patients who are free of any known coronary artery disease or heart failure who underwent clinician-referred exercise treadmill stress testing at Henry Ford Health Systems between 1991 and 2009 and had a complete 5-year follow-up. At the completion of the fifth year, 5,099 of those patients have developed diabetes. The dataset contained 62 attributes classified into four categories: demographic characteristics, disease history, medication use history, and stress test vital signs. We developed an Ensembling-based predictive model using 13 attributes that were selected based on their clinical importance, Multiple Linear Regression, and Information Gain Ranking methods. The negative effect of the imbalance class of the constructed model was handled by Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE). The overall performance of the predictive model classifier was improved by the Ensemble machine learning approach using the Vote method with three Decision Trees (Na\u00efve Bayes Tree, Random Forest, and Logistic Model Tree) and achieved high accuracy of prediction (AUC = 0.92). The study shows the potential of ensembling and SMOTE approaches for predicting incident diabetes using cardiorespiratory fitness data.",

            "abstract": "The genome of periodontal pathogen Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans exhibits substantial variations in gene content among unrelated strains primarily due to the presence or absence of genomic islands. This study examined the genomic stability of A. actinomycetemcomitans during its persistent infection in the same host. Four pairs of A. actinomycetemcomitans strains, each pair isolated from an individual over time (0-10 years), were examined for their gains\/losses of genes by whole genome sequencing, comparative genomic hybridization by microarray and PCR analysis. Possible effects due to genomic changes were further assessed by comparative transcriptome analysis using microarrays. The results showed that each pair of strains was clonally identical based on phylogenetic analysis of 150 core genes. A novel 24.1-Kb plasmid found in strain S23A was apparently lost in the sibling strain I23C. A 353-bp inversion affecting two essential genes of the serotype-specific gene cluster was found in the serotype antigen-nonexpressing strain I23C, while the same gene cluster was intact in the serotype-expressing sibling strain S23A. A 2,293-bp deletion affecting a gene encoding oxaloacetate decarboxylase and its neighbor region was found in strain SCC2302 but not in the sibling strain AAS4a. However, no evidence of gains or losses of genomic islands was found in the paired strains. Transcriptome profiles showed little or no difference in the paired strains. In conclusion, the genome of A. actinomycetemcomitans appears to be relatively stable during short-term infection. Several types of genomic changes were observed in the paired strains of A. actinomycetemcomitans recovered from the same subjects, including a mutation in serotype-specific gene cluster that may allow the bacteria to evade host immune response.",

            "abstract": "Simian hemorrhagic fever (SHF) is an often lethal disease of Asian macaques. Simian hemorrhagic fever virus (SHFV) is one of at least three distinct simian arteriviruses that can cause SHF, but pathogenesis studies using modern methods have been scarce. Even seemingly straightforward studies, such as examining viral tissue and cell tropism in vivo, have been difficult to conduct due to the absence of standardized SHFV-specific reagents. Here we report the establishment of an in situ hybridization assay for the detection of SHFV and distantly related Kibale red colobus virus 1 (KRCV-1) RNA in cell culture. In addition, we detected SHFV RNA in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues from an infected rhesus monkey (Macaca mulatta). The assay is easily performed and can clearly distinguish between SHFV and KRCV-1. Thus, if further developed, this assay may be useful during future studies evaluating the mechanisms by which a simian arterivirus with a restricted cell tropism can cause a lethal nonhuman primate disease similar in clinical presentation to human viral hemorrhagic fevers.",

Although hydrogels with directed unidirectional response, i.e. capable of bending actuated by different chemical components reaction in response to several stimuli including water and electric fields, these hydrogels are capable of being actuated in one direction only by the stimulus. By contrast the challenge of building a device that is capable of responding to the same cue (in this case a temperature gradient) to bend in either direction remains unmet. Here, inspired by the structure of pine cone scales, we design a temperature-sensitive hydrogel with bending directed an imposed fishing line. The layers with same PNIPAAm always shrinks in response to the heat. Even the layers made with different chemical property, bends away from a warm surface, whether the warm surface is applied at its upper or lower boundary. To design the bending hydrogel we exploited the coupled responses of the hydrogel; a fishing line intercalating structure and change its construction. In addition to revealing a new capability of stimulus sensitive hydrogels, our study gives insight into the structural features of pine cone bending.",

The contents of blood TDP, thiamine monophosphate (TMP), and thiamine, as well as the activities of thiamine diphosphatase (TDPase), thiamine monophosphatase (TMPase), and thiamine pyrophosphokinase (TPK), were assayed by high performance liquid chromatography.<label>RESULTS<\/label>Blood TDP contents of AD patients were significantly lower than those in control subjects (79.03 \u00b1 23.24 vs. 127.60 \u00b1 22.65 nmol\/L, P<0.0001). Activities of TDPase and TMPase were significantly enhanced in AD patients than those in control subjects (TDPase: 1.24 \u00b1 0.08 vs. 1.00 \u00b1 0.04, P < 0.05; TMPase: 1.22 \u00b1 0.04 vs. 1.00 \u00b1 0.06, P < 0.01). TPK activity remained unchanged in AD as compared with that in control (0.93 \u00b1 0.04 vs. 1.00 \u00b1 0.04, P > 0.05). Blood TDP levels correlated negatively with TDPase activities (r = -0.2576, P = 0.0187) and positively with TPK activities (r = 0.2426, P = 0.0271) in all participants.<label>CONCLUSION<\/label>Enhanced TDPase and TMPase activities may contribute to the reduction of TDP level in AD patients. The results imply that an imbalance of phosphorylation-dephosphorylation related to thiamine and glucose metabolism may be a potential target for AD prevention and therapy.",

            "abstract": "Liver regeneration after partial hepatectomy (PHx) is a time-dependent process, which is tightly regulated by multiple signaling cascades. Failure of this complex process leads to posthepatectomy liver failure (PHLF), which is associated with a high rate of mortality. Thus, it is extremely important to establish a useful biomarker of liver regeneration to help prevent PHLF. Here, we hypothesized that alterations in the plasma peptide profile may predict liver regeneration following PHx and hence we set up a diagnostic platform for monitoring posthepatectomy outcome. We chronologically analyzed plasma peptidomic profiles of 5 partially hepatectomized microminipigs using the ClinProtTM system, which consists of magnetic beads and MALDI-TOF\/TOF MS. We identified endogenous circulating peptides specific to each phase of the postoperative course after PHx in pigs. Notably, peptide fragments of histones were detected immediately after PHx; the presence of these fragments may trigger liver regeneration in the very acute phase after PHx. An N-terminal fragment of hemoglobin subunit \u03b1 (3627 m\/z) was detected as an acute-phase-specific peptide. In the recovery phase, the short N-terminal fragments of albumin (3028, 3042 m\/z) were decreased, whereas the long N-terminal fragment of the protein (8926 m\/z) was increased. To further validate and extract phase-specific biomarkers using plasma peptidome after PHx, plasma specimens of 4 patients who underwent PHx were analyzed using the same method as we applied to pigs. It revealed that there was also phase-specificity in peptide profiles, one of which was represented by a fragment of complement C4b (2378 m\/z). The strategy described herein is highly efficient for the identification and characterization of peptide biomarkers of liver regeneration in a swine PHx model. This strategy is feasible for application to human biomarker studies and will yield clues for understanding liver regeneration in human clinical trials.",

The objective of this study is to measure abdominal fat with 3T MRI using free software for image analysis and to correlate these findings with anthropometric and laboratory parameters in adolescents.<label>METHODS<\/label>This prospective observational study included 24 overweight\/obese and 33 healthy adolescents (mean age 16.55 years). All participants underwent abdominal MRI exams. Visceral and subcutaneous fat area and percentage were correlated with anthropometric parameters, lipid profile, glucose metabolism, and insulin resistance. Student's t test and Mann-Whitney's test was applied. Pearson's chi-square test was used to compare proportions. To determine associations Pearson's linear correlation or Spearman's correlation were used.<label>RESULTS<\/label>In both groups, waist circumference (WC) was associated with visceral fat area (P = 0.001 and P = 0.01 respectively), and triglycerides were associated with fat percentage (P = 0.046 and P = 0.071 respectively). In obese individuals, total cholesterol\/HDL ratio was associated with visceral fat area (P = 0.03) and percentage (P = 0.09), and insulin and HOMA-IR were associated with visceral fat area (P = 0.001) and percentage (P = 0.005).<label>CONCLUSIONS<\/label>3T MRI can provide reliable and good quality images for quantification of visceral and subcutaneous fat by using a free software package. The results demonstrate that WC is a good predictor of visceral fat in obese adolescents and visceral fat area is associated with total cholesterol\/HDL ratio, insulin and HOMA-IR.",

            "abstract": "Smartphones are now owned by most young adults in many countries. Installed applications regularly update while the phone is in standby. If it is kept near the body, this can lead to considerably higher exposure to radiofrequency electromagnetic radiation than occurred without internet access. Very little is known about current smartphone carrying habits of young women. This survey used an online questionnaire to ask about smartphone location under several circumstances to inform the power calculation for a women's health study. They were also asked about risk perceptions. Data was analysed using Pearson chi square. Three age categories were made: 15-20, 21-30, 31-40. Smartphones were generally kept on standby (96% by day, 83% at night). Of all participants, in the last week the most common locations of the phone when not in use or during passive use was off-body (86%), in the hand (58%), a skirt\/trouser pocket (57%), or against the breast (15%). Pocket and near-the-breast storage were significant by age (\u03c7215.04, p = 0.001 and \u03c7210.96, p = 0.04, respectively), both positively influenced by the youngest group. The same influence lay in the association between holding the phone (\u03c7211.082, p = 0.004) and pocket-storage (\u03c7219.971, p<0.001) during passive use. For calls, 36.5% solely used the phone against the head. More than half kept the phone 20-50 cms from their head at night (53%), while 13% kept it closer than 20 cms. Many (36%) thought RF-EMR exposure was related to health problems while 16% did not. There was no relationship between thinking RF-EMR exposure causes health problems in general and carrying the phone against the upper or lower body (p = 0.69 and p = 0.212, respectively). However, calls with the phone against the head were positively related to perception of health risk (\u03c72 6.695, p = 0.035). Our findings can be used in the power calculation for a case-control study.",

            "title": "SVM and SVM Ensembles in Breast Cancer Prediction.",
            "abstract": "Breast cancer is an all too common disease in women, making how to effectively predict it an active research problem. A number of statistical and machine learning techniques have been employed to develop various breast cancer prediction models. Among them, support vector machines (SVM) have been shown to outperform many related techniques. To construct the SVM classifier, it is first necessary to decide the kernel function, and different kernel functions can result in different prediction performance. However, there have been very few studies focused on examining the prediction performances of SVM based on different kernel functions. Moreover, it is unknown whether SVM classifier ensembles which have been proposed to improve the performance of single classifiers can outperform single SVM classifiers in terms of breast cancer prediction. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to fully assess the prediction performance of SVM and SVM ensembles over small and large scale breast cancer datasets. The classification accuracy, ROC, F-measure, and computational times of training SVM and SVM ensembles are compared. The experimental results show that linear kernel based SVM ensembles based on the bagging method and RBF kernel based SVM ensembles with the boosting method can be the better choices for a small scale dataset, where feature selection should be performed in the data pre-processing stage. For a large scale dataset, RBF kernel based SVM ensembles based on boosting perform better than the other classifiers.",

These calcifications appeared in patients older than 50 years, the prevalence increases with age and they may be associated with cognitive decline. The aim of this study was to determine the histological basis (the presence, severity and location) of these CT-detected hippocampal calcifications of post-mortem brains.CT scans of seven post-mortem brains were scored for the presence and severity (mild, moderate, severe) of hippocampal calcification. After this, samples from nine hippocampi (bilateral in two brains, unilateral in five brains) were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (HE) to indicate the cytoarchitecture, with Elastica van Gieson to analyse the elastic connective tissue of the vessel walls and with von Kossa for detection of calcium.In four brains (six hippocampi), calcifications were both found on CT and in corresponding histology. In three brains (three hippocampi), calcifications were absent on CT and corresponding histology. In histology, mild calcifications were located in the tail and severe calcifications involved the tail, body and sometimes the head of the hippocampus. The calcifications co-localised with precapillaries, capillaries and arteries of the molecular and granular layers of the dentate gyrus and the Cornu Ammonis 1.In this study, calcifications of the hippocampus as seen on CT scans were histologically located in vascular structures of the tail, body and head of the hippocampus.",

            "abstract": "Lumbar spinal stenosis causes cauda equina and nerve root compression, resulting in neurological symptoms. Although trunk flexion during level walking may alleviate these symptoms by enabling spinal canal decompression, some patients do not use this strategy. We aimed to identify the kinetic and kinematic variables that affect trunk flexion in patients during level walking. Gait was recorded in 111 patients using a three-dimensional motion capture system and six force plates. From the data recorded, walking velocity, bilateral step length, cycle time, maximum trunk flexion angle, forward pelvic tilt angle, pelvic rotation angle, maximum and minimum joint angles, and moment and power of the lower limb were calculated. Then a step-wise multiple regression analysis was conducted to identify kinetic and kinematic variables affecting trunk flexion. The maximum hip extension angle (\u03b2 = 0.416), maximum hip flexion moment (\u03b2 = -0.348), and step length (\u03b2 = 0.257) were identified as variables significantly affecting the trunk flexion angle. The coefficient of determination adjusted for the degree of freedom was 0.294 (p < 0.05). Our results suggest that patients with lumbar spinal stenosis choose one of two strategies to alleviate symptoms during walking. One strategy is gait with trunk flexion posture to increase step length and hip extension angle. The other strategy is gait with trunk upright posture to decrease step length and hip extension angle.",

            "abstract": "In high throughput applications, such as those found in bioinformatics and finance, it is important to determine accurate probability distribution functions despite only minimal information about data characteristics, and without using human subjectivity. Such an automated process for univariate data is implemented to achieve this goal by merging the maximum entropy method with single order statistics and maximum likelihood. The only required properties of the random variables are that they are continuous and that they are, or can be approximated as, independent and identically distributed. A quasi-log-likelihood function based on single order statistics for sampled uniform random data is used to empirically construct a sample size invariant universal scoring function. Then a probability density estimate is determined by iteratively improving trial cumulative distribution functions, where better estimates are quantified by the scoring function that identifies atypical fluctuations. This criterion resists under and over fitting data as an alternative to employing the Bayesian or Akaike information criterion. Multiple estimates for the probability density reflect uncertainties due to statistical fluctuations in random samples. Scaled quantile residual plots are also introduced as an effective diagnostic to visualize the quality of the estimated probability densities. Benchmark tests show that estimates for the probability density function (PDF) converge to the true PDF as sample size increases on particularly difficult test probability densities that include cases with discontinuities, multi-resolution scales, heavy tails, and singularities. These results indicate the method has general applicability for high throughput statistical inference.",

Arctic marine fauna is dominated by amphipods in terms of abundance and biomass. These peracarids are an important marine order of crustaceans but the number of species found in the different Canadian oceans is currently unknown. Furthermore, most species are difficult to identify due to poor taxonomic descriptions and morphological convergence. The aim of this study was to assess the species diversity of marine amphipods in the three Canadian oceans using DNA barcoding. To do so, we produced a database of DNA barcodes of amphipods from the three Canadian Oceans publicly available from the BOLD website to which we added 310 new sequences from the Canadian Arctic Archipelago. We first delimited amphipod species based on barcode gap detection techniques and tree based method (bPTP) and then compared the composition of amphipods among the three oceans in order to assess the influence of past transarctic exchanges on Arctic diversity. Our analysis of 2309 sequences which represent more than 250 provisional species revealed a high connectivity between the Atlantic and Arctic Oceans. Our results also suggest that a single threshold to delimitate species is not suitable for amphipods. This study highlights the challenges involved in species delimitation and the need to obtain complete barcoding inventories in marine invertebrates.",

            "abstract": "Computer-based interventions target improvement of physical and emotional functioning in patients with chronic pain and functional somatic syndromes. However, it is unclear to what extent which interventions work and for whom. This systematic review and meta-analysis (registered at PROSPERO, 2016: CRD42016050839) assesses efficacy relative to passive and active control conditions, and explores patient and intervention factors. Controlled studies were identified from MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsychInfo, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library. Pooled standardized mean differences by comparison type, and somatic symptom, health-related quality of life, functional interference, catastrophizing, and depression outcomes were calculated at post-treatment and at 6 or more months follow-up. Risk of bias was assessed. Sub-group analyses were performed by patient and intervention characteristics when heterogeneous outcomes were observed. Maximally, 30 out of 46 eligible studies and 3,387 participants were included per meta-analysis. Mostly, internet-based cognitive behavioral therapies were identified. Significantly higher patient reported outcomes were found in comparisons with passive control groups (standardized mean differences ranged between -.41 and -.18), but not in comparisons with active control groups (SMD = -.26 - -.14). For some outcomes, significant heterogeneity related to patient and intervention characteristics. To conclude, there is a minority of good quality evidence for small positive average effects of computer-based (cognitive) behavior change interventions, similar to traditional modes. These effects may be sustainable. Indications were found as of which interventions work better or more consistently across outcomes for which patients. Future process analyses are recommended in the aim of better understanding individual chances of clinically relevant outcomes.",

However, the role of HMGB-1 in acute exacerbation of fibrosing interstitial pneumonia (AE-FIP) has not been adequately studied.We prospectively measured serum HMGB1 level from disease onset to day 7 in 36 patients with AE-FIP6 patients had missing data because of early death (within 7 days). We then examined the association of HMGB1 level and outcome, and the associations of rhTM with HMGB1 level and outcome in 19 patients who were treated with rhTM (rhTM group) and 11 patients who were not (control group).Data from 36 AE-FIP patients (mean age, 73.5\u00b16.7years) were analyzed. Serum HMGB1 level was significantly higher in patients with AE-FIP than in those with stable idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (16.4\u00b113.5 vs 5.7\u00b12.6 ng\/ml, respectively; p = 0.003). HMGB1 was significantly lower on day 7 than at AE-FIP onset in survivors (6.5\u00b14.8 vs 14.7\u00b112.9 ng\/ml, respectively; p = 0.02) but not in nonsurvivors (14.6\u00b110.5 vs 9.2\u00b14.8 ng\/ml, respectively; p = 0.08). Although HMGB1 level at day 7 was significantly lower after rhTM treatment than at AE-FIP onset (8.4\u00b16.1 vs 15.2\u00b112.5 ng\/ml, respectively; p = 0.02), it did not significantly decrease in patients receiving treatments other than rhTM (11.3\u00b111.3 vs 8.3\u00b15.3 ng\/ml, respectively; p = 0.37). Three-month survival was 60.0% in the rhTM group and 36.4% in the control group (p = 0.449). In multivariate analysis, a decrease in HMGB1 was a significant independent predictor of 3-month survival (Odds ratio, 12.4; p = 0.007).rhTM lowers serum HMGB1 level and may improve survival after AE-FIP. HMGB1 may be a promising therapeutic target for AE-FIP.",

            "abstract": "The main objective of the study was to evaluate neuraminidase inhibiting (NI) antibodies against A\/H1N1pdm09 influenza viruses in the community as a whole and after infection. We evaluated NI serum antibodies against A\/California\/07\/09(H1N1)pdm and A\/South Africa\/3626\/2013(H1N1)pdm in 134 blood donors of different ages using enzyme-linked lectin assay and in 15 paired sera from convalescents with laboratory confirmed influenza. The neuraminidase (NA) proteins of both A\/H1N1pdm09 viruses had minimal genetic divergence, but demonstrated different enzymatic and antigenic properties. 5.2% of individuals had NI antibody titers \u22651:20 against A\/South Africa\/3626\/2013(H1N1)pdm compared to 53% of those who were positive to A\/California\/07\/2009(H1N1)pdm NA. 2% of individuals had detectable NI titers against A\/South Africa\/3626\/13(H1N1)pdm and 47.3% were positive to A\/California\/07\/2009(H1N1)pdm NA among participants negative to hemagglutinin (HA) of A\/H1N1pdm09 but positive to seasonal A\/H1N1. The lowest NI antibody levels to both A\/H1N1pdm09 viruses were detected in individuals born between 1956 and 1968. Our data suggest that NI antibodies against A\/South Africa\/3626\/13 (H1N1)pdm found in the blood donors could have resulted from direct infection with a new antigenic A\/H1N1pdm09 variant rather than from cross-reaction as a result of contact with previously circulating seasonal A\/H1N1 variants. The immune responses against HA and NA were formed simultaneously right after natural infection with A\/H1N1pdm09. NI antibodies correlated with virus-neutralizing antibodies when acquired shortly after influenza infection. A group of middle-aged patients with the lowest level of anti-NA antibodies against A\/California\/07\/2009 (H1N1)pdm was identified, indicating the highest-priority vaccination against A\/H1N1pdm09 viruses.",

The present study is an indirect estimation of the population size of students with high-risk behaviors in select universities of medical sciences.A total of 801 students from two University of Medical Sciences at Tehran and Alborz University of Medical Sciences were selected through convenience sampling. Six subgroups of high-risk behaviors were examined in the study, including Tramadol use, cannabis use, opium use, alcohol consumption, extramarital heterosexual intercourse, and heterosexual intercourse in return for money. To estimate the social network size in the study population, each participant was asked to name their close student friends from the two select universities. Data were collected using a checklist designed for this purpose.The participants' mean number of close friends from the selected medical universities was C = 8.14 (CI: 7.54-8.75). Within these social networks, friends with extramarital heterosexual intercourse (5.53%) and friends who consumed alcohol (4.92%) had the highest frequency, and friends who used opium (0.33%) had the lowest frequency. The variables of age, gender, marital status, type of residence and academic degree were significantly related to the likelihood of having close friends with certain high-risk behaviors (P<0.001).According to the results obtained, alcohol consumption and extramarital heterosexual intercourse are very common among students. Special HIV prevention programs are therefore necessary for this age group.",

Cancer critically increases the thrombotic risk whereas Factor V Leiden is the most common pro-thrombotic mutation. The impact of the factor V Leiden on the risk of VTE in cancer patients remains uncertain.To assess the impact of factor V Leiden mutation in cancer-associated thrombosis.The EDITH hospital-based case-control study enrolled 182 patients with cancer and VTE as well as 182 control patients with cancer, matched for gender, age and cancer location, between 2000 and 2012, in the University Hospital of Brest. All cases and controls were genotyped for the factor V Leiden mutation and interviewed with a standardized questionnaire.Twenty one of 182 (11.5%) patients with cancer-associated thrombosis carried the factor V Leiden mutation and 4 of 182 (2.2%) controls with cancer but no venous thrombosis. In multivariate analysis including cancer stage and family history of VTE, cancer patients with factor V Leiden mutation had a seven-fold increased risk of venous thromboembolism (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 7.04; 95% CI, 2.01-24.63).The pro-thrombotic Factor V Leiden mutation was found to be an independent additional risk factor for venous thromboembolism in cancer patients and might therefore be considered in the individual thrombotic risk assessment.",

The database is gender balanced consisting of 24 professional actors, vocalizing lexically-matched statements in a neutral North American accent. Speech includes calm, happy, sad, angry, fearful, surprise, and disgust expressions, and song contains calm, happy, sad, angry, and fearful emotions. Each expression is produced at two levels of emotional intensity, with an additional neutral expression. All conditions are available in face-and-voice, face-only, and voice-only formats. The set of 7356 recordings were each rated 10 times on emotional validity, intensity, and genuineness. Ratings were provided by 247 individuals who were characteristic of untrained research participants from North America. A further set of 72 participants provided test-retest data. High levels of emotional validity and test-retest intrarater reliability were reported. Corrected accuracy and composite \"goodness\" measures are presented to assist researchers in the selection of stimuli.

            "abstract": "The HIV\/AIDS pandemic remains an enormous global health concern. Despite effective prevention options, 2.6 million new infections occur annually, with women in developing countries accounting for more than half of these infections. New prevention strategies that can be used by women are urgently needed. Topical microbicides specific for HIV-1 represent a promising prevention strategy. Conceptually, using harmless bacteria to display peptides or proteins capable of blocking entry provides an inexpensive approach to microbicide development. To avoid the potential pitfalls of engineering commensal bacteria, our strategy is to genetically display infection inhibitors on a non-native bacterium and rely on topical application of stabilized bacteria before potential virus exposure. Due to the high density cell-surface display capabilities and the inherent low toxicity of the bacterium, the S-layer mediated protein display capabilities of the non-pathogenic bacterium Caulobacter crescentus has been exploited for this approach. We have demonstrated that C. crescentus displaying MIP1\u03b1 or CD4 interfered with the virus entry pathway and provided significant protection from HIV-1 pseudovirus representing clade B in a standard single cycle infection assay. Here we have expanded our C. crescentus based microbicide approach with additional and diverse classes of natural and synthetic inhibitors of the HIV-1 entry pathway. All display constructs provided variable but significant protection from HIV-1 infection; some with protection as high as 70%. Further, we describe protection from infection with additional viral clades. These findings indicate the significant potential for engineering C. crescentus to be an effective and readily adaptable HIV-1 microbicide platform.",

            "abstract": "The goal of influenza vaccination programs is to reduce influenza-associated disease outcomes. Therefore, estimating the reduced burden of influenza as a result of vaccination over time and by age group would allow for a clear understanding of the value of influenza vaccines in the US, and of areas where improvements could lead to greatest benefits.To estimate the direct effect of influenza vaccination in the US in terms of averted number of cases, medically-attended cases, and hospitalizations over six recent influenza seasons.Using existing surveillance data, we present a method for assessing the impact of influenza vaccination where impact is defined as either the number of averted outcomes or as the prevented disease fraction (the number of cases estimated to have been averted relative to the number of cases that would have occurred in the absence of vaccination).We estimated that during our 6-year study period, the number of influenza illnesses averted by vaccination ranged from a low of approximately 1.1 million (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.6-1.7 million) during the 2006-2007 season to a high of 5 million (CI 2.9-8.6 million) during the 2010-2011 season while the number of averted hospitalizations ranged from a low of 7,700 (CI 3,700-14,100) in 2009-2010 to a high of 40,400 (CI 20,800-73,000) in 2010-2011. Prevented fractions varied across age groups and over time. The highest prevented fraction in the study period was observed in 2010-2011, reflecting the post-pandemic expansion of vaccination coverage.Influenza vaccination programs in the US produce a substantial health benefit in terms of averted cases, clinic visits and hospitalizations. Our results underscore the potential for additional disease prevention through increased vaccination coverage, particularly among nonelderly adults, and increased vaccine effectiveness, particularly among the elderly.",

            "abstract": "mRNA stability is one among many parameters that can potentially affect the level of recombinant gene expression in bacteria. Blocking of the entire prokaryotic transcription machinery by addition of rifampicin is commonly used in protocols for analysis of mRNA stability. Here we show that such treatment can be effectively replaced by a simple, non-invasive method based on removal of the relevant transcriptional inducers and that the mRNA decay can then be followed by qRT-PCR. To establish the methodology we first used the m-toluate-inducible XylS\/Pm expression cassette as a model system and analyzed several examples of DNA modifications causing gene expression stimulation in Escherichia coli. The new method allowed us to clearly discriminate whether an improvement in mRNA stability contributes to observed increases in transcript amounts for each individual case. To support the experimental data a simple mathematical fitting model was developed to calculate relative decay rates. We extended the relevance of the method by demonstrating its application also for an IPTG-inducible expression cassette (LacI\/Ptac) and by analyzing features of the bacteriophage T7-based expression system. The results suggest that the methodology is useful in elucidating factors controlling mRNA stability as well as other specific features of inducible expression systems. Moreover, as expression systems based on diffusible inducers are almost universally available, the concept can be most likely used to measure mRNA decay for any gene in any cell type that is heavily used in molecular biology research.",

            "abstract": "Osteosarcoma (OS), a highly aggressive primary bone tumor, belongs to the most common solid tumors in growing children. Since specific molecular targets for OS treatment remain to be identified, surgical resection combined with multimodal (neo-)adjuvant chemotherapy is still the only way to help respective individuals. We have previously identified the protein tyrosine phosphatase Rptp\u03b6 as a marker of terminally differentiated osteoblasts, which negatively regulates their proliferation in vitro. Here we have addressed the question if Rptp\u03b6 can function as a tumor suppressor protein inhibiting OS development in vivo. We therefore analyzed the skeletal phenotype of mice lacking Ptprz1, the gene encoding Rptp\u03b6 on a tumor-prone genetic background, i.e. Trp53-heterozygosity. By screening a large number of 52 week old Trp53-heterozygous mice by contact radiography we found that Ptprz1-deficiency significantly enhanced OS development with 19% of the mice being affected. The tumors in Ptprz1-deficient Trp53-heterozygous mice were present in different locations (spine, long bones, ribs), and their OS nature was confirmed by undecalcified histology. Likewise, cell lines derived from the tumors were able to undergo osteogenic differentiation ex vivo. A comparison between Ptprz1-heterozygous and Ptprz1-deficient cultures further revealed that the latter ones displayed increased proliferation, a higher abundance of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins and resistance towards the influence of the growth factor Midkine. Our findings underscore the relevance of Rptp\u03b6 as an attenuator of proliferation in differentiated osteoblasts and raise the possibility that activating Rptp\u03b6-dependent signaling could specifically target osteoblastic tumor cells.",

We hypothesized that Twitter real-time data would produce a unique and reproducible signal within minutes of multiple casualty events and we investigated the timing of the signal compared with other hospital disaster notification mechanisms.Using disaster specific search terms, all relevant tweets from the event to 7 days post-event were analyzed for 5 recent US based multiple casualty events (Boston Bombing [BB], SF Plane Crash [SF], Napa Earthquake [NE], Sandy Hook [SH], and Marysville Shooting [MV]). Quantitative and qualitative analysis of tweet utilization were compared across events.Over 3.8 million tweets were analyzed (SH 1.8 m, BB 1.1m, SF 430k, MV 250k, NE 205k). Peak tweets per min ranged from 209-3326. The mean followers per tweeter ranged from 3382-9992 across events. Retweets were tweeted a mean of 82-564 times per event. Tweets occurred very rapidly for all events (<2 mins) and represented 1% of the total event specific tweets in a median of 13 minutes of the first 911 calls. A 200 tweets\/min threshold was reached fastest with NE (2 min), BB (7 min), and SF (18 mins). If this threshold was utilized as a signaling mechanism to place local hospitals on standby for possible large scale events, in all case studies, this signal would have preceded patient arrival. Importantly, this threshold for signaling would also have preceded traditional disaster notification mechanisms in SF, NE, and simultaneous with BB and MV.Social media data has demonstrated that this mechanism is a powerful, predictable, and potentially important resource for optimizing disaster response. Further investigated is warranted to assess the utility of prospective signally thresholds for hospital based activation.",

            "abstract": "In recent years it has become increasingly clear that astrocytes play a much more active role in neural processes than the traditional view of them as supporting cells suggests. Although not electrically excitable, astrocytes exhibit diverse Ca2+ dynamics across spatial and temporal scales, more or less dependent on the animal's behavioral state. Ca2+ dynamics range from global elevations lasting multiple seconds encompassing the soma up to the finest processes, to short elevations restricted to so-called microdomains within fine processes. Investigations of astrocyte Ca2+ dynamics have particularly benefitted from the development of Genetically-Encoded Calcium Indicators (GECIs). GECI expression can be achieved non-invasively in a cell type-specific manner and it can be genetically targeted to subcellular domains. The GCaMP family, a group of GECIs derived from the green fluorescent protein, has experienced some of the fastest advancements during the past decade. As a consequence we are now facing the challenge of needing to compare published data obtained with different versions of GECIs. With the intention to provide some guidance, here we compared Ca2+ dynamics across scales in awake transgenic mice expressing either the well-established GCaMP3, or the increasingly popular GCaMP6f, specifically in astrocytes. We found that locomotion-induced global Ca2+ elevations in cortical astrocytes displayed only minor kinetic differences and their apparent dynamic ranges for Ca2+ sensing were not different. In contrast, Ca2+ waves in processes and microdomain Ca2+ transients were much more readily detectable with GCaMP6f. Our findings suggest that behavioral state-dependent global astrocyte Ca2+ responses can be studied with either GCaMP3 or GCaMP6f whereas the latter is more appropriate for studies of spatially restricted weak and fast Ca2+ dynamics.",

            "abstract": "The fine structures of Fc N-glycan modulate the biological functions and physicochemical properties of antibodies. By remodeling N-glycan to obtain a homogeneous glycoform or chemically modified glycan, antibody characteristics can be controlled or modified. Such remodeling can be achieved by transglycosylation reactions using a mutant of endoglycosidase from Streptococcus pyogenes (Endo-S) and glycan oxazoline. In this study, we generated improved mutants of Endo-S by introducing additional mutations to the D233Q mutant. Notably, Endo-S D233Q\/Q303L, D233Q\/E350Q, and several other mutations resulted in transglycosylation efficiencies exceeding 90%, with a single-digit donor-to-substrate ratio of five, and D233Q\/Y402F\/D405A and several other mutations resulted in slightly reduced transglycosylation efficiencies accompanied by no detectable hydrolysis activity for 48 h. We further demonstrated that the combined use of mutants of Endo-S with Endo-M or Endo-CC, endoglycosidases from Mucor hiemalis and Coprinopsis cinerea, enables one-pot transglycosylation from sialoglycopeptide to antibodies. This novel reaction enables glycosylation remodeling of antibodies, without the chemical synthesis of oxazoline in advance or in situ.",

            "abstract": "Paclitaxel belongs to the taxanes family and it is used, alone or in multidrug regimens, for the therapy of several solid tumours, such as breast-, lung-, head and neck-, and ovarian cancer. Standard dosing of chemotherapy does not take into account the many inter-patient differences that make drug exposure highly variable, thus leading to the insurgence of severe toxicity. This is particularly true for paclitaxel considering that a relationship between haematological toxicity and plasma exposure was found. Therefore, in order to treat patients with the correct dose of paclitaxel, improving the overall benefit-risk ratio, Therapeutic Drug Monitoring is necessary. In order to quantify paclitaxel and its main metabolite, 6\u03b1-hydroxy-paclitaxel, in patients' plasma, we developed a new, sensitive and specific HPLC-MS\/MS method applicable to all paclitaxel dosages used in clinical routine. The developed method used a small volume of plasma sample and is based on quick protein precipitation. The chromatographic separation of the analytes was achieved with a SunFire\u2122 C18 column (3.5 \u03bcM, 92 \u00c5, 2,1 x 150 mm); the mobile phases were 0.1% formic acid\/bidistilled water and 0.1% formic acid\/acetonitrile. The electrospray ionization source worked in positive ion mode and the mass spectrometer operated in selected reaction monitoring mode. Our bioanalytical method was successfully validated according to the FDA-EMA guidelines on bioanalytical method validation. The calibration curves resulted linear (R2 \u22650.9948) over the concentration ranges (1-10000 ng\/mL for paclitaxel and 1-1000 ng\/mL for 6\u03b1-hydroxy-paclitaxel) and were characterized by a good accuracy and precision. The intra- and inter-day precision and accuracy were determined on three quality control concentrations for paclitaxel and 6\u03b1-hydroxy-paclitaxel and resulted respectively <9.9% and within 91.1-114.8%. In addition, to further verify the assay reproducibility, we tested this method by re-analysing the incurred samples. This bioanalytical method was employed with success to a genotype-guided phase Ib study of weekly paclitaxel in ovarian cancer patients treated with a wide range of drug's dosages.",

One system studied in detail is avian reproduction, where molecular analyses have revealed dramatic variation in rates of extra-pair paternity-the frequency with which broods contain individuals sired by different males. Despite the attention the topic has received, identification of ecological predictors of the observed variation remains elusive. In this study we evaluate how structural equation modeling-which allows for simultaneous estimation of covariation between all variables in a model-can help identify significant relationships between ecological variables and extra-pair paternity. We estimated the correlation of eight different variables using data from 36 species of passerines by including them in six different models of varying complexity. We recover strong support for species with lower rates of male care having higher rates of extra-pair paternity. Our results also suggest that testes size, range size, and longevity all potentially have a relationship with rates of extra-pair paternity; however, interpretation of this result is more challenging. More generally, these results demonstrate the utility of applying structural equation modeling to understanding correlations among interacting variables in complex biological systems.",

            "abstract": "Five full-scale wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in China using typical biodegradation processes (SBR, oxidation ditch, A2\/O) were selected to assess the removal of four popular artificial sweeteners (ASs). All four ASs (acesulfame (ACE), sucralose (SUC), cyclamate (CYC) and saccharin (SAC)) were detected, ranging from 0.43 to 27.34\u03bcg\/L in the influent. Higher concentrations of ASs were measured in winter. ACE could be partly removed by 7.11-50.76% through biodegradation and especially through the denitrifying process. The A2\/O process was the most efficient at biodegrading ASs. Adsorption (by granular activated carbon (GAC) and magnetic resin) and ultraviolet radiation-based advanced oxidation processes (UV\/AOPs) were evaluated to remove ASs in laboratory-scale tests. The amounts of resin adsorbed were 3.33-18.51 times more than those of GAC except for SUC. The adsorption ability of resin decreased in the order of SAC > ACE > CYC > SUC in accordance with the pKa. Degradation of ASs followed pseudo-first-order kinetics in UV\/H2O2 and UV\/PDS. When applied to the secondary effluent, ASs could be degraded from 30.87 to 99.93% using UV\/PDS in 30 minutes and UV\/PDS was more efficient and economic.",

            "abstract": "Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is frequent in Intensive Care Unit (ICU) patients. In the specific case of patients treated with Veno-Arterial Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation Support (VA-ECMO), VAP treatment failures (VAP-TF) have been incompletely investigated.To investigate the risk factors of treatment failure (VAP-TF) in a large cohort of ICU patients treated with VA-ECMO, we conducted a retrospective study in a Surgical ICU about patients assisted with VA-ECMO between January 1, 2013, and December 31, 2014. Diagnosis of VAP was confirmed by a positive quantitative culture of a respiratory sample. VAP-TF was defined as composite of death attributable to pneumonia and relapse within 28 days of the first episode.In total, 152 patients underwent ECMO support for > 48h. During the VA-ECMO support, 85 (55.9%) patients developed a VAP, for a rate of 60.6 per 1000 ECMO days. The main pathogens identified were Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterobacteriaceae. VAP-TF occurred in 37.2% of patients and was associated with an increased 28-day mortality (Hazard Ratio 3.05 [1.66; 5.63], P<0.001), and VA-ECMO assistance duration (HR 1.47 [1.05-2.05], P = 0.025). Risk factors for VAP-TF were renal replacement therapy (HR 13.05 [1.73; 98.56], P = 0.013) and documentation of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (HR 2.36 [1.04; 5.35], P = 0.04).VAP in patients treated with VA-ECMO is associated with an increased morbidity and mortality. RRT and infection by Pseudomonas aeruginosa appear as strong risks factors of treatment failure. Further studies seem necessary to precise the best antibiotic management in these patients.",

            "abstract": "Neurodegeneration occurs during the early stages of multiple sclerosis. It is an essential, devastating part of the pathophysiology. Tools for measuring the degree of neurodegeneration could improve diagnostics and patient characterization.This study aimed to determine the diagnostic value of biomarkers of degeneration in patients with recent clinical onset of suspected multiple sclerosis, and to evaluate these biomarkers for characterizing disease course.This cross-sectional study included 271 patients with clinical features of suspected multiple sclerosis onset and was the baseline of a prospective study. After diagnostic investigations, the patients were classified into the following disease groups: patients with clinically isolated syndrome (n = 4) or early relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (early RRMS; n = 93); patients with relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis with disease durations \u22652 years (established RRMS; n = 39); patients without multiple sclerosis, but showing symptoms (symptomatic controls; n = 89); and patients diagnosed with other diseases (n = 46). In addition, we included healthy controls (n = 51) and patients with progressive multiple sclerosis (n = 23). We analyzed six biomarkers of neurodegeneration: cerebrospinal fluid neurofilament light chain levels; cerebral spinal fluid glial fibrillary acidic protein; cerebral spinal fluid tau; retinal nerve fiber layer thickness; macula volume; and the brain parenchymal fraction.Except for increased cerebral spinal fluid neurofilament light chain levels, median 670 ng\/L (IQR 400-2110), we could not find signs of early degeneration in the early disease group with recent clinical onset. However, the intrathecal immunoglobin G production and cerebral spinal fluid neurofilament light chain levels showed diagnostic value. Moreover, elevated levels of cerebral spinal fluid glial fibrillary acidic protein, thin retinal nerve fiber layers, and low brain parenchymal fractions were associated with progressive disease, but not with the other phenotypes. Thin retinal nerve fiber layers and low brain parenchymal fractions, which indicated neurodegeneration, were associated with longer disease duration.In clinically suspected multiple sclerosis, intrathecal immunoglobin G production and neurofilament light chain levels had diagnostic value. Therefore, these biomarkers could be included in diagnostic work-ups for multiple sclerosis. We found that the thickness of the retinal nerve fiber layer and the brain parenchymal fraction were not different between individuals that were healthy, symptomatic, or newly diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. This finding suggested that neurodegeneration had not reached a significant magnitude in patients with a recent clinical onset of multiple sclerosis.",

            "abstract": "<p>Abstract<\/p> <p>Background<\/p> <p>A key problem of drug development is to decide which compounds to evaluate further in expensive clinical trials (Phase I- III). This decision is primarily based on the primary targets and mechanisms of action of the chemical compounds under consideration. Whole-genome expression measurements have shown to be useful for this process but current approaches suffer from requiring either a large number of mutant experiments or a detailed understanding of the regulatory networks.<\/p> <p>Results<\/p> <p>We have designed an algorithm, CutTree that when applied to whole-genome expression datasets identifies the primary affected genes (PAGs) of a chemical compound by separating them from downstream, indirectly affected genes. Unlike previous methods requiring whole-genome deletion libraries or a complete map of gene network architecture, CutTree identifies PAGs from a limited set of experimental perturbations without requiring any prior information about the underlying pathways. The principle for CutTree is to iteratively filter out PAGs from other recurrently active genes (RAGs) that are not PAGs. The <it>in silico <\/it>validation predicted that CutTree should be able to identify 3\u20134 out of 5 known PAGs (~70%). In accordance, when we applied CutTree to whole-genome expression profiles from 17 genetic perturbations in the presence of galactose in Yeast, CutTree identified four out of five known primary galactose targets (80%). Using an exhaustive search strategy to detect these PAGs would not have been feasible (>10<sup>12 <\/sup>combinations).<\/p> <p>Conclusion<\/p> <p>In combination with genetic perturbation techniques like short interfering RNA (siRNA) followed by whole-genome expression measurements, CutTree sets the stage for compound target identification in less well-characterized but more disease-relevant mammalian cell systems.<\/p> ",

            "abstract": "<p>Abstract<\/p> <p>Background<\/p> <p>Breast cancer is a collection of diseases in which molecular phenotypes can act as both indicators and mediators of therapeutic strategy. Therefore, candidate therapeutics must be assessed in the context of multiple cell lines with known molecular phenotypes. Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and curcumin (CCM) are dietary compounds known to antagonize breast cancer cell proliferation. We report that these compounds in combination exert a variable antiproliferative effect across multiple breast cell lines, which is synergistic in SK-BR-3 cells and triggers cell signaling events not predicted by the activity of either compound alone.<\/p> <p>Methods<\/p> <p>Dose response curves for CCM and DHA were generated for five breast cell lines. Effects of the DHA+ CCM combination on cell proliferation were evaluated using varying concentrations, at a fixed ratio, of CCM and DHA based on their individual ED<sub>50<\/sub>. Detection of synergy was performed using nonlinear regression of a sigmoid dose response model and Combination Index approaches. Cell molecular network responses were investigated through whole genome microarray analysis of transcript level changes. Gene expression results were validated by RT-PCR, and western blot analysis was performed for potential signaling mediators. Cellular curcumin uptake, with and without DHA, was analyzed via flow cytometry and HPLC.<\/p> <p>Results<\/p> <p>CCM+DHA had an antiproliferative effect in SK-BR-3, MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-361, MCF7 and MCF10AT cells. The effect was synergistic for SK-BR-3 (ER<sup>- <\/sup>PR<sup>- <\/sup>Her2<sup>+<\/sup>) relative to the two compounds individually. A whole genome microarray approach was used to investigate changes in gene expression for the synergistic effects of CCM+DHA in SK-BR-3 cells lines. CCM+DHA triggered transcript-level responses, in disease-relevant functional categories, that were largely non-overlapping with changes caused by CCM or DHA individually. Genes involved in cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, inhibition of metastasis, and cell adhesion were upregulated, whereas genes involved in cancer development and progression, metastasis, and cell cycle progression were downregulated. Cellular pools of PPAR\u03b3 and phospho-p53 were increased by CCM+DHA relative to either compound alone. DHA enhanced cellular uptake of CCM in SK-BR-3 cells without significantly enhancing CCM uptake in other cell lines.<\/p> <p>Conclusions<\/p> <p>The combination of DHA and CCM is potentially a dietary supplemental treatment for some breast cancers, likely dependent upon molecular phenotype. DHA enhancement of cellular curcumin uptake is one potential mechanism for observed synergy in SK-BR-3 cells; however, transcriptomic data show that the antiproliferation synergy accompanies many signaling events unique to the combined presence of the two compounds.<\/p> ",

Immediately and 120 min following EX1, subjects consumed one of three calorically-similar beverages (285\u2013300 kcal) in a cross-over design: carbohydrate-only (CHO; 75 g per beverage), high-carbohydrate\/low-protein (HCLP; 45 g CHO, 25 g Pro, 0.5 g fat), or low-carbohydrate\/high-protein (LCHP; 8 g CHO, 55 g Pro, 4 g fat). After 4 h of recovery, subjects performed subsequent exercise (EX2; 20 min at 70% VO&lt;sub&gt;2peak&lt;\/sub&gt; + 20 km time-trial). Beverages were also consumed following EX2. Blood glucose levels (30 min after beverage ingestion) differed across all treatments (CHO &gt; HCLP &gt; LCHP; &lt;em&gt;p&lt;\/em&gt; &lt; 0.05), and serum insulin was higher following CHO and HCLP ingestion &lt;em&gt;versus&lt;\/em&gt; LCHP. Peak quadriceps force, serum creatine kinase, muscle soreness, and fatigue\/energy ratings measured pre- and post-exercise were not different between treatments. EX2 performance was not significantly different between CHO (48.5 \u00b1 1.5 min), HCLP (48.8 \u00b1 2.1 min) and LCHP (50.3 \u00b1 2.7 min).

These intensified the practice of agriculture along the river valley basin. We conducted a study to assess malaria vector diversity, dynamics and malaria transmission in the area.<\/p> <p>Methods<\/p> <p>A cross-sectional entomological study was performed in September 2008 in 20 villages of the middle Senegal River valley to evaluate the variations of <it>Anopheles <\/it>density according to local environment. A longitudinal study was performed, from October 2008 to January 2010, in 5 selected villages, to study seasonal variations of malaria transmission.<\/p> <p>Results<\/p> <p>Among malaria vectors, 72.34% of specimens collected were <it>An. arabiensis<\/it>, 5.28% <it>An. gambiae <\/it>of the S molecular form, 3.26% M form, 12.90% <it>An. pharoensis<\/it>, 4.70% <it>An. ziemanni<\/it>, 1.48% <it>An. funestus <\/it>and 0.04% <it>An. wellcomei<\/it>. <it>Anopheles <\/it>density varied according to village location. It ranged from 0 to 21.4 <it>Anopheles<\/it>\/room\/day and was significantly correlated with the distance to the nearest ditch water but not to the river.<\/p> <p>Seasonal variations of <it>Anopheles <\/it>density and variety were observed with higher human biting rates during the rainy season (8.28 and 7.55 <it>Anopheles <\/it>bite\/man\/night in October 2008 and 2009 respectively). Transmission was low and limited to the rainy season (0.05 and 0.06 infected bite\/man\/night in October 2008 and 2009 respectively). During the rainy season, the endophagous rate was lower, the anthropophagic rate higher and L1014F kdr frequency higher.<\/p> <p>Conclusions<\/p> <p>Malaria vectors are present at low-moderate density in the middle Senegal River basin with <it>An. arabiensis <\/it>as the predominant species. Other potential vectors are <it>An. gambiae <\/it>M and S form and <it>An. funestus<\/it>. Nonetheless, malaria transmission was extremely low and seasonal.<\/p> ",

Injuries were recorded on an injury form to documents any injury seen and treatment provided by the health care team. These data were later used for this study. The injury form describes the athlete and nature, site, severity and mechanism of the injury.<\/p> <p>Results<\/p> <p>The overall rate of injuries was 62.9\/1,000 athlete-exposures (A-E). The males (79.9\/1,000 A-E) sustained significantly more injuries than the females (25.3\/1,000 A-E). The lower extremities were the most commonly injured body region in the men (32.0 \/1,000 A-E), followed by the head and neck (18.3\/1,000 A-E). Injuries to the spine (neck, upper back, low back and coccyx) were the third most often injured body region in males (13.8\/1,000 A-E). All injuries to the women were sustained to the lower extremities. The most common type of injury in women was the contusion (15.2\/1,000 A-E). However, men's most common type of injury was the sprain (22.8\/1,000 A-E) followed by joint dysfunction (13.7\/1,000A-E). Concussions were only reported in males (6.9\/1,000 A-E). Compared to international counterparts, the Canadian men and women recorded lower total injury rates. However, the males incurred more cerebral concussions than their American colleagues (4.7\/1,000 A-E).<\/p> <p>Conclusions<\/p> <p>Similar to what was found in previous studies, the current investigation seems to suggest that areas of particular concern for preventive measures involve the head and neck as well as the lower extremities. This is the first paper to identify spinal joint dysfunction.<\/p> ",

We present a case of a follicular variant of papillary carcinoma and squamous carcinoma in the thyroid. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first documentation of a collision tumor with a papillary carcinoma and a squamous carcinoma within the thyroid gland. The clinicopathological features and immunohistochemical profile are reported. The theories of origin, epidemiology and management are discussed with a literature review.<\/p> <p>Case presentation<\/p> <p>A 65 year old woman presented with a large thyroid swelling of 10 years duration and with swellings on the back and scalp which were diagnosed to be a follicular variant of papillary thyroid carcinoma with metastasis. Clinical examination, radiology and endoscopy ruled out any other abnormality of the upper aerodigestive tract. The patient was treated surgically with a total thyroidectomy with central compartment clearance and bilateral selective neck dissections. The histopathology revealed a collision tumor with components of both a follicular variant of papillary carcinoma and a squamous carcinoma. Immunohistochemical analysis confirmed the independent origin of these two primary tumors. Adjuvant radio iodine therapy directed toward the follicular derived component of the thyroid tumor and external beam radiotherapy for the squamous component was planned.<\/p> <p>Conclusion<\/p> <p>Collision tumors of the thyroid gland pose a diagnostic as well as therapeutic challenge. Metastasis from distant organs and contiguous primary tumors should be excluded. The origins of squamous cancer in the thyroid gland must be established to support the true evolution of a collision tumor and to plan treatment. Treatment for collision tumors depends upon the combination of primary tumors involved and each component of the combination should be treated like an independent primary. The reporting of similar cases with longer follow-up will help define the epidemiology, biology and establish standardized protocols for treatment of these extremely rare tumors.<\/p> ",

The purpose of this study, Using an analytical method for the production of \u200efragility curves for a road bridge in Mazandaran Province. Since this curves used for planning before and after the \u200eearthquake, and in order to increase the reliability of them, in this study we tried to use the most accurate analytical \u200emethods (non-linear time history analysis) and most prestigious modeling assumptions. Due to the specific \u200echaracteristics of far fault earthquakes, effects of such earthquakes on bridges have been investigated using fragility \u200ecurves. Due to the geometry of the bridge for exact analysis, bridges was under 100 pairs of earthquake \u200erecords in orthogonal directions and fragility curves was drawn and then were compared. Observed that changing the diameter of the bridge piers affect how much on the. One of \u200ethe common simplifications used in modeling are: elimination of abutment and foundation and pile by fixing the \u200eabutment and foundations in modeling. It can be seen that by eliminating this effect, increase the median values of \u200efragility and in fact to reduce probability of vulnerability in Charts.

            "abstract": "Although visceral artery aneurysms are rare, mortality due to their rupture is high, estimated\r\nat even 25\u201375%. That is why it is significant to detect each such lesion. Visceral\r\nartery aneurysms are usually asymptomatic and found incidentally during examinations\r\nperformed for other indications. Autopsy results suggest that most asymptomatic aneurysms\r\nremain undiagnosed during lifetime. Their prevalence in the population is therefore\r\nhigher. The manifestation of a ruptured aneurysm depends on its location and may\r\ninvolve intraperitoneal hemorrhage, gastrointestinal and portal system bleeding with\r\nconcomitant portal hypertension and bleeding from esophageal varices. Wide access to\r\ndiagnostic tests, for example ultrasound, computed tomography or magnetic resonance\r\nimaging, helps establish the correct diagnosis and a therapeutic plan as well as select\r\nappropriate treatment. After a procedure, the same diagnostic tools enable assessment\r\nof treatment efficacy, or are used for the monitoring of aneurysm size and detection of\r\npotential complications in cases that are ineligible for treatment. The type of treatment\r\ndepends on the size of an aneurysm, the course of the disease, risk of rupture and risk\r\nassociated with surgery or endovascular procedure. Endovascular treatment is preferred\r\nin most cases. Aneurysms are excluded from the circulation using embolization coils,\r\nethylene vinyl alcohol, stents, multilayer stents, stent grafts and histoacryl glue (or a\r\ncombination of these methods).",

The presence of long run common trend between the Macedonian and Croatian stock market indices is identified by applying Johansen\u2019s cointegration maximum eigenvalue and trace tests, while potential causal relations are examined by employing Granger\u2019s causality tests. Data sample spans from January 3rd, 2005 to March 31st, 2017. The stock market indices were found to be co-integrated with significant relationships. A bi-directional pattern of causality is documented between the Macedonian and Croatian returns. This pattern is remarkably stable and suggests significant economic ties between the investors in Macedonian and Croatian stock markets. The findings are important for the investors meaning that they cannot gain diversification benefits of investing in the Croatian or Macedonian stock market.",

            "abstract": "In the present study, a general method for geometry of fluidic networks is developed with emphasis on pressure-driven flows in the microfluidic applications. The design method is based on general features of network's geometry such as cross-sectional area and length of channels. Also, the method is applicable to various cross-sectional shapes such as circular, rectangular, triangular, and trapezoidal cross sections. Using constructal theory, the flow resistance, energy loss and performance of the network are optimized. Also, by this method, practical design strategies for the fabrication of microfluidic networks can be improved. The design method enables rapid prediction of fluid flow in the complex network of channels and is very useful for improving proper miniaturization and integration of microfluidic networks. Minimization of flow resistance of the network of channels leads to universal constants for consecutive cross-sectional areas and lengths. For a Y-shaped network, the optimal ratios of consecutive cross-section areas (Ai+1\/Ai) and lengths (Li+1\/Li) are obtained as Ai+1\/Ai = 2\u22122\/3 and Li+1\/Li = 2\u22121\/3, respectively. It is shown that energy loss in the network is proportional to the volume of network. It is also seen when the number of channels is increased both the hydraulic resistance and the volume occupied by the network are increased in a similar manner. Furthermore, the method offers that fabrication of multi-depth and multi-width microchannels should be considered as an integral part of designing procedures. Finally, numerical simulations for the fluid flow in the network have been performed and results show very good agreement with analytic results.",

The two cases for effective thermal conductivity are discussed in the analysis through H-C model. The impacts of the governing parameters on the flow, heat and mass transfer aspects of the issue are talked about. Under the patronage of small values of permeable Reynolds number and relaxation\/contraction parameter, we locate that, when wall contraction is together with suction, flow turning is encouraged close to the wall where the boundary layer is shaped. On the other hand, when the wall relaxation is coupled with injection, the flow adjacent to the porous walls decreased. The outcome of the exploration may be beneficial for applications of biotechnology. Numerical solutions for the velocity, heat and mass transfer rate at the boundary are obtained and analyzed.",

The purpose of the empirical research was to discover the effects of loyalty programs on customer satisfaction. Research has shown (N= 53) that the loyalty program is not the determinating factor. All other examined factors such as product range, price, locationof the store and customers relationship proved to be the more relevant for consumer satisfaction.",

            "abstract": "<p>Means to overcome tumor hypoxia have been the subject of clinical investigations since the 1960's; however these studies have yet to find a treatment which is widely accepted. It has been known for nearly a century that hypoxic cells are more resistant to radiotherapy than aerobic cells, and tumor hypoxia is a major factor leading to the resistance of tumors to radiation treatment as well as several cytotoxic agents. In this manuscript, the application of ultrasound combined with oxygen-carrier microbubbles is demonstrated as a method to locally increase dissolved oxygen. Microbubbles can also be imaged by ultrasound, thus providing the opportunity for image-guided oxygen delivery. Simulations of gas diffusion and microbubble gas exchange show that small amounts (down to 5 vol%) of a low-solubility osmotic gas can substantially increase microbubble persistence and therefore production rates and stability of oxygen-carrier microbubbles. Simulations also indicate that the lipid shell can be engineered with long-chain lipids to increase oxygen payload during in vivo transit. Experimental results demonstrate that the application of ultrasound to destroy the microbubbles significantly enhances the local oxygen release. We propose this technology as an application for ultrasound image-guided release of oxygen directly to hypoxic tissue, such as tumor sites to enhance radiotherapy.<\/p>",

Because the formation of microjet-pits relates with the evolution of cavitation erosion on engineering materials, corresponding study will promote the understanding on the mechanism of cavitation erosion. However, little study on the microjet-pits has been carried out, especially in the particles-water mixture. In this study, we firstly demonstrated the microjet-pits on the carbon steel would be significantly inhibited by Al particles in water. Such inhibition effect indicated that particular particles might not only provide growth sites for cavitation bubbles but also affect the collapse of cavitation bubbles near a solid surface. Our study deepened the understanding on the ultrasonic cavitation erosion in the particles-water mixture.",

The low cross sections and short nuclear lifetimes involved in many of these reactions make their experimental determination challenging, requiring developments in beams and instrumentation. A selection of developments in nuclear astrophysics instrumentation is discussed, using as examples projects involving the nuclear astrophysics group at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. These developments will be key to the instrumentation necessary to fully exploit nuclear astrophysics opportunities at the Facility for Rare Isotope Beams which is currently under construction.",

Current solid-state photovoltaic cells and conventional photoelectrochemical cells are not capable of directly storing the converted energy, which has to be facilitated by connecting to external storing devices. We demonstrate a device architecture that can convert and store solar energy in the electrical form within an intrinsically single structure. Mobile charge is internally stored, based on the coupling between photoelectrochemical and ferroelectric effects. The tested device architecture can be photo-charged under 1000 W\/m2 of white light to an open-circuit voltage of 0.47V with a capacity of 37.62 mC\/cm2. After removal of the light source, the mobile charge stored lasts more than 8 hours, and the open-circuit output voltage lasts more than 24 hours.",

The delivery and release was accurately controlled using different evanescent optical fields at different regions of the NF by changing the injected optical power. The NPs (polystyrene, 713 nm diameter) were delivered along the NF (690 nm diameter) toward the decorated defect when a laser beam at a wavelength of 980 nm was injected into the NF. At an injected optical power of 25 mW, the NPs were delivered at an average velocity of 2.9 \u03bcm\/s and 90% of them were released around the barrier, which is set beside the defect. When the power was increased to 40 mW, the average delivery velocity reached 4.2 \u03bcm\/s and 92% of the NPs were released at the side of the defect opposite to the barrier. By further increasing the power to 80 mW, the average delivery velocity further increased to 8.2 \u03bcm\/s. Consequently, 90% of the NPs moved across the defect and were delivered to the next destination at an average velocity of 5.2 \u03bcm\/s. The experimental results were then explained theoretically using numerical simulations.",

In this structure, catalyst nanofibers are embedded in a membrane that separates the growth ambient into carbon-supplying and carbon-precipitating environments. The catalyst nanofibers pierce through the membrane so that carbon source gas is supplied only to one end of the catalyst fibers and nanocarbon fibers grow continuously at the other end. To realize this structure, self-supporting anodized alumina was used as a membrane, and its nano-through-holes were filled with catalyst Ni in supercritical CO2 fluid. Direct carbon growth from the Ni nanofibers was confirmed using this catalyst structure.\n         ",

Here we investigate experimentally and theoretically the possibility of using graphene oxide (GO) as a flocculant to remove methylene blue (MB) from water. Experimental results show that GO can remove almost all MB from aqueous solutions at its optimal dosages and molecular dynamics simulations indicate that MB cations quickly congregate around GO in water. Furthermore, PIXEL energy contribution analysis reveals that most of the strong interactions between GO and MB are of a van der Waals (London dispersion) character. These results offer new insights for shedding light on the molecular mechanism of interaction between GO and organic pollutants.",

            "abstract": "During the settler expansion between the decades 1920-1930 in the Alto Paran\u00e1 of Misiones, the tobacco was for German-Brazilian settlers a product to obtain monetary incomes and for their own consum. The aim of this paper is to analyze the link between producers and collectors of tobacco, trying to identify the conflicting elements of this relationship (disputes over the classification and the product price). The heuristic work focused on Johann Company, the company's largest collectors of Puerto Rico Colony and the only one that keeps the records since its beginings (1929). The product their collected the most time was tobacco (1929-1985), and in descending order of importance their also collected tung, cassava starch and lard. Throughout the book collection of tobacco sales it is showed both sides of the production of tobacco: tobacco producers and collectors. This information has been enriched by interviews with key informants.<br>Durante la expansi\u00f3n colonizadora de las d\u00e9cadas de 1920-1930 en el Alto Paran\u00e1 Misionero, el tabaco fue para los colonos alemanes-brasile\u00f1os un cultivo destinado a la obtenci\u00f3n de ingresos monetarios y bienes de consumo. El objetivo de este trabajo es analizar el v\u00ednculo entre productores y acopiadores de tabaco, tratando de identificar los elementos conflictivos de esta relaci\u00f3n (disputas por la clasificaci\u00f3n y el precio del producto). El trabajo heur\u00edstico se focaliz\u00f3 en la Compa\u00f1\u00eda Johann, la empresa acopiadora m\u00e1s grande de la colonia Puerto Rico y la \u00fanica que mantiene los registros desde su creaci\u00f3n (1929). El producto que acopi\u00f3 por m\u00e1s tiempo fue el tabaco (1929-1985), y en orden de importancia decreciente tambi\u00e9n acopiaron tung, almid\u00f3n de mandioca y grasa de cerdo. A trav\u00e9s de los libros de acopio y de venta de tabaco enfardelado se da vida a las dos caras de la producci\u00f3n del tabaco: los productores tabacaleros y los acopiadores.

Many existing fabrication processes remain expensive and complicated, which limits a broad range of application of the artificial compound eye. In this paper, we report a fast fabrication method for curved microlens array by using DMD-based maskless lithography. When a three-dimensional (3D) target curved profile is projected into a two-dimensional (2D) mask, arbitrary curved microlens array can be flexibly and efficiently obtained by utilizing DMD-based lithography. In order to verify the feasibility of this method, a curved PDMS microlens array with 90 micro lenslets has been fabricated. The physical and optical characteristics of the fabricated microlens array suggest that this method is potentially suitable for applications in artificial compound eye.",

The simulations are carried out on isothermal argon gas (Lennard-Jones fluid) over a range of rarefaction levels under various confinements (unbounded gas, parallel reflective wall and explicit solid platinum wall bounded gas) in a nanoscale domain. The system is also analyzed independently in constitutive sub-systems to calculate the corresponding local mean free paths. Our studies which predominate in the transition regime substantiate the boundary limiting effect on mean free paths owing to the sharp diminution in molecular free paths near the planar boundaries. These studies provide insight to the transport phenomena of rarefied gases through nanochannels which have established their potential in microscale and nanoscale heat transfer applications.\n",

In situ Raman studies under high pressure were carried out in a diamond anvil cell at room temperature which indicate a structural transition from cubic to hexagonal phase at and above 20.6 GPa. In the decompression cycle, Yb2O3 retained its high pressure phase. We have observed a Stark line in the Raman spectra at 337.5 cm\u22121 which arises from the electronic transition between 2F5\/2 and 2F7\/2 multiplates of Yb3+ (4f13) levels. These were followed by temperature dependent Raman studies in the range of 80\u2013440 K, which show an unusual mode hardening with increasing temperature. The hardening of the most dominant mode (Tg + Ag) was analyzed in light of the theory of anharmonic phonon-phonon interaction and thermal expansion of the lattice. Using the mode Gr\u00fcneisen parameter obtained from high pressure Raman measurements; we have calculated total anharmonicity of the Tg + Ag mode from the temperature dependent Raman data.",

            "abstract": "Present work reports significantly high levels of ionization, eventually leading to Coulomb explosion of Tetramethyl silane (TMS) clusters, on interaction with laser pulses of intensity \u223c109 W\/cm2. Tetramethyl silane clusters, prepared by supersonic expansion were photoionized at 266, 355 or 532 nm and the resultant ions were detected using time-of-flight mass spectrometer. It is observed that wavelength of irradiation and the size of the cluster are crucial parameters which drastically affect the nature of charge species generated upon photoionization of cluster. The results show that clusters absorb significantly higher energy from the laser field at longer wavelengths (532 nm) and generate multiply charged silicon and carbon ions which have large kinetic energies. Further, laser-cluster interaction at different wavelengths has been quantified and charge densities at 266, 355 and 532 nm are found to be 4x 1010, 5x 1010 and 5x 1011 charges\/cm3 respectively. These unusual results have been rationalized based on dominance of secondary ionization processes at 532 nm ultimately leading to Coulomb explosion of clusters. In another set of experiments, multiply charged ions of Ar (up to +5 state) and Kr (up to +6 state) were observed when TMS doped inert gas clusters were photoionized at 532 and 355 nm. The extent of energy absorption at these two wavelengths is clearly manifested from the charge state of the atomic ions generated upon Coulomb disintegration of the doped cluster. These experiments thus demonstrate a novel method for generation of multiply charged atomic ions of inert gases at laser intensity of \u223c 109 W\/cm2. The average size of the cluster exhibiting Coulomb explosion phenomena under giga watt intensity conditions has been estimated to be \u223c 6 nm. Experimental results obtained in the present work agree qualitatively with the model proposed earlier [D. Niu, H. Li, F. Liang, L. Wen, X. Luo, B. Wang, and H. Qu, J. Chem. Phys. 122, 151103(2005)] and point towards interaction of quasi-free electrons, generated during primary multiphoton ionization step, with a given wavelength in the presence of Coulombic field.",

            "abstract": "Introduction: The potential risks related to drug exposure during pregnancy represent a vast chapter in modern obstetrics and data regarding the safety of antihypertensive drugs during pregnancy are relatively scarce.   Case report: A 37-year-old patient discovered her fifth pregnancy at our hospital after 26 weeks and 4 days of gestation. She reported a history of hypertension and was currently being treated with Losartan. Hospitalization was recommended for the patient and further evaluation of fetal vitality was performed. On the fourth day an ultrasound was performed, resulting in a severe oligohydramnios, fetal centralization and abnormal ductus venosus. After 36 hours, the newborn died. Pathologic evaluation: At autopsy, the skullcap had large fontanels and deficient ossification. The kidneys were slightly enlarged. A microscopic examination detected underdevelopment of the tubules and the presence of some dilated lumens. Immunohistochemical detection of epithelial membrane antigen was positive. Immunoreactivity of CD 15 was also assayed to characterize the proximal tubules, and lumen collapse was observed in some regions.   Discussion: Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin receptor antagonists (ARAs) are among the most widely prescribed drugs for hypertension. They are often used by hypertensive women who are considering become pregnant. While their fetal toxicity in the second or third trimesters has been documented, their teratogenic effect during the first trimester has only recently been demonstrated.   Conclusion: Constant awareness by physicians and patients should be encouraged, particularly in regard to the prescription of antihypertensive drugs in women of childbearing age who are or intend to become pregnant.",

In this study, Tobin Tax, which is the first significant step towards taxation of foreign currency transactions, has been discussed theoretically and considering its possible effects on application. Also, in this context, the initiatives of countries such as USA, Belgium, France and Austria regarding international implementation of Tobin Tax and its derivatives are being evaluated. The intended use of the taxes, determination of transactions exempt from tax and international cooperation in the implementation of taxation are possible problems that can be faced regarding Tobin Tax. In this study the conclusion, which the effects of Tobin Tax in developing and developed countries will be different but imposing such tax regarding cyclic balance of the world economy will be a positive improvement, has been reached.",

Hydrogen Peroxide (H2O2) is one of bleaching substance that most commonly used. Use of H2O2 in a high concentration can cause a negative impact on the oral cavity. Honey is a natural ingredient that can whiten teeth. This study aimed to determine the effect of concentration of honey on tooth colour changes of teeth whitening process.Method: This research was an experimental in vitro study using pretest-posttest design with teeth as a research sample. 24 premolars teeth as samples were soaked in various concentration of honey (25%, 35%, 50%, 75%). The colour of teeth were measured with a spectrophotometer before and after treatment. Teeth colour were analyzed by paired samples T-test. Result: Paired T-test showed p<0.05, which means that concentration of honey affected on tooth colour changes. One way ANOVA test results showed concentrations of honey significantly affect tooth discoloration (p <0,05). Post hoc test results showed significant difference On the concentration of 25% of the concentration of honey 50%, 75%, but on a concentration of 25% honey and 35% there is no significant difference. Conclusion: From these results, it can be concluded that the concentration of honey affected on tooth colour changes in an in vitro tooth whitening process.\n\nKeywords:\u00c2\u00a0Honey, Hydrogen\u00c2\u00a0Peroxide (H2O2),\u00c2\u00a0Tooth Colour Changes",

Infrequent oddball stimulation was applied to one of the fingers (%25 of the time). Continuous electroencephalography (EEG), electrooculography (EOG) and electromyography (EMG) recordings were sorted into sleep phases according to the guidelines set by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM). Responses recorded from the C3 and C4 electrodes were examined as somatosensory regions of priority. Paired samples T-tests were used for statistical analysis.\r\n\r\nResults\r\nN100, P200, N300, P450, N550, P900 Nlate wave forms were clearly observed for both frequent and infrequent stimuli in light and deep sleep. Responses to both target and non-target stimuli on the right hand were found to be similar to each other.\r\n\r\nDiscussion\r\nBrain responsiveness continues in sleep; however electrophysiological response pattern can vary. Furthermore as processes such as directed attention, stimulus discrimination and working memory cannot be voluntarily employed during sleep; responses to both kinds of stimuli are similar to one another.",

Chlorhexidine therapy used to reduce the number of pathogenic bacteria causing periodontitis. Green tea contains polyphenols such as epigallocatechin-3-gallic as antibacterial agent that can kill the bacteria Porphyromonas gingivalis. This study aims to determine di\ufb00erences in the e\ufb00ectiveness of chlorhexidine gluconate 0.2% with green tea (Camellia sinensis) various concentrations to decrease the amount of bacteria Porphyromonas gingivalis.\nMethod: This research was experimental with post test only design. Method used in antibacterial test was a drop plate misra. The experimental group consisted of six groups: chlorhexidine gluconate 0.2% and green tea group with a concentration of 100%, 75%, 50%, 25% and 12.5%. minimum bactericidal concentrations againts Porphyromonas gingivalis was evidenced by counting the number of colonies that formed on agar. Analysis data was using One Way ANOVA continued by Post hoc tests Tamhane.\nResult: The results showed that chlorhexidine gluconate 0.2% with green tea e\ufb00ective to decrease the amount of bacteria Porphyromonas gingivalis(ANOVA p <0.05). The results between the groups showed green tea 100%, 75% and 25%, have same e\ufb00ect compared to chlorhexidine gluconate 0.2% in reducing Porphyromonas gingivalis.\nConclusion: In this experiment showed that chlorhexidine gluconate 0.2% and green tea extract 100%, 75%, 50%, 25% and 12.5% were able to decrease the amount of Porphyromonas gingivalis.",

            "abstract": "Background: Tooth loss has serious functional, esthetic disabilities, and compromising the patients\u2019 quality of life. Dental implant treatment has become increasingly common for the management tooth loss. Different clinical situations, such as narrow edentulous space, are often encountered in which modifications have to be considered in order to achieve successful rehabilitation. One piece dental implan provided a solution for rehabilitation of narrow edentulous space. The purpose of this paper is to report a rehabilitation management of narrow edentulous space. \nCase Management: A 22-year-old woman had an upper right canine #13 malposition so there was a narrow space between upper right lateral insisiv #12 and upper right first premolar #14. The spacing between upper right lateral insisivus #12 and upper right first premolar #14 was found to be about 5 mm. Radiograph was assessed for type of bone and for the presence of any pathology. A patient given an initial dental treatment such as scalling root planning and extraction of caninus #13. Following the clinical evaluation, the procedure and complication of implant therapy were explained and consent taken for proposed treatment. One piece dental implant site was anesthetized. Flaps on the buccal aspect were raised. One Piece dental implant inserted using dental implant kit. On completion of treatment, the patient\u2019s esthetics and funcions improved. Conclusion: This study observed that one piece dental implants are suitable for rehabilitation of narrow edentulous space",

            "abstract": "Cooperation between Yugoslavia and USA was continued even after the election of new American president and administration during 1969. In the era of detante Americans created a low-profile policy. Bilateral cooperation between Yugoslavia and the USA has significantly increased as compared to the previous period. US presence in Yugoslavia increased in the area of economy, culture, military development and on the political level. Kissinger\u2019s visit to Yugoslavia had a large impact especially on the Yugoslav-US political relations and had confirmed the values and importance of the principles of the Washington Declaration. During 1974 US foreign policy has accepted and approved Yugoslav position in the Non-alignement movement. The development of good relations between the two countries was one of the main components of Yugoslav foreign policy through that period. The final American aim was to preserve Yugoslav indepedence, stability and unity in relation to the USSR. Both sides had reached the consensus that the peace and stability in the world was impossible to achieve without progress in solving economic issues. Kissinger\u2019s visit marked the end of the phase of \u201efreezing\u201c political relations due to US pressure on Yugoslavia.",

            "abstract": "The discovery that an apparent forward-propagating otoacoustic emission (OAE) induced basilar membrane vibration has created a serious debate in the field of cochlear mechanics. The traditional theory predicts that OAE will propagate to the ear canal via a backward traveling wave on the basilar membrane, while the opponent theory proposed that the OAE will reach the ear canal via a compression wave. Although accepted by most people, the basic phenomenon of the backward traveling wave theory has not been experimentally demonstrated. In this study, for the first time, we showed the backward traveling wave by measuring the phase spectra of the basilar membrane vibration at multiple longitudinal locations of the basal turn of the cochlea. A local vibration source with a unique and precise location on the cochlear partition was created to avoid the ambiguity of the vibration source in most previous studies. We also measured the vibration pattern at different places of a mechanical cochlear model. A slow backward traveling wave pattern was demonstrated by the time-domain sequence of the measured data. In addition to the wave propagation study, a transmission line mathematical model was used to interpret why no tonotopicity was observed in the backward traveling wave.",

            "abstract": "Winter and spring tornado activity tends to be heightened during the La Ni\u00f1a phase of the El Ni\u00f1o\/Southern Oscillation and suppressed during the El Ni\u00f1o phase. Despite these tendencies, some La Ni\u00f1a seasons have fewer tornadoes than expected and some El Ni\u00f1o seasons have more than expected. To gain insight into such anomalous seasons, the two La Ni\u00f1a winters and springs with the fewest tornadoes and the two El Ni\u00f1o winters and springs with the most tornadoes between 1979 and 2016 are identified and analyzed in this study. The relationships between daily tornado count and the Global Wind Oscillation and Madden-Julian Oscillation in these anomalous seasons are also explored. Lastly, seasonal and daily composites of upper-level flow, low-level flow and humidity, and atmospheric instability are generated to describe the environmental conditions in the anomalous seasons. The results of this study highlight the potential for large numbers of tornadoes to occur in a season if favorable conditions emerge in association with individual synoptic-scale events, even during phases of the El Ni\u00f1o\/Southern Oscillation, Global Wind Oscillation, and Madden-Julian Oscillation that seem to be unfavorable for tornadoes. They also highlight the potential for anomalously few tornadoes in a season even when the oscillations are in favorable phases.",

We report a case of a previously healthy 56-year-old male, who presented with abdominal pain and jaundice. The patient was originally diagnosed with cholecystitis, treated with cholecystectomy, which was complicated by abdominal abscess. One week following discharge, the patient was readmitted with fever, chills, and leukocytosis. Computed tomography (CT) guided liver biopsies demonstrated an epithelioid to spindle cell neoplasm with markedly atypical nuclei and prominent necrosis infiltrating between hepatocytes. Immunohistochemical studies were negative for epithelial, melanocytic, and hematolymphoid differentiation. Positron emission tomography (PET) was performed, which showed a single markedly hypermetabolic central hepatic mass (14 x 8.5 x 8.5 cm) with likely central necrosis, consistent with primary malignancy. The patient was treated with one cycle of chemotherapy (doxorubicin and ifosfamide), refusing additional cycle due to medication side effects. The patient subsequently succumbed to complications associated with the malignancy and died within 19 days of diagnosis.",

            "abstract": "In order to determine the energy dissipation capacity of flexure critical reinforced concrete (RC) columns reasonably, an expression for describing the hysteretic behavior including loading and unloading characteristics of flexure critical RC columns is presented, and then, a new equivalent viscous damping (EVD) ratio model including its simplified format, which is interpreted as a function of a displacement ductility factor and a ratio of secant stiffness to yield stiffness of columns, is developed based on the proposed hysteretic loop expression and experimental data from the PEER column database. To illustrate the application of the proposed equivalent damping ratio model, a case study of pushover analysis on a flexure critical RC bridge with a single-column pier is provided. The analytical results are also compared with the results obtained by other models, which indicate that the proposed model is more general and rational in predicting energy dissipation capacity of flexure critical RC structures subjected to earthquake excitations.",

This paper aims to propose a method for optimizing the price of credit default swaps (CDS) for the dynamic PPP system. This study investigates the credit risk measurement of PPP project financing and the pricing of risk mitigation instruments which are widely used in the case of immature markets in the early stage of China\u2019s PPP development. Based on the credit risk measurement theory of the corporate and debt ratings, this paper considers the differences in various credit enhancement methods in the equity-like debt agreement and determines the credit rating of the equity-like debt in PPP projects. Some optimization methods are also proposed to derive the probability of default, so as to determine the price of the credit risk mitigation instrument of CDS which is based on the equity-like debt.",

            "abstract": "Machining process is characterized by randomness, nonlinearity, and uncertainty, leading to the dynamic changes of machine tool machining errors. In this paper, a novel model combining the data processing merits of metabolic grey model (MGM) with that of nonlinear autoregressive (NAR) neural network is proposed for machining error prediction. The advantages and disadvantages of MGM and NAR neural network are introduced in detail, respectively. The combined model first utilizes MGM to predict the original error data and then uses NAR neural network to forecast the residual series of MGM. An experiment on the spindle machining is carried out, and a series of experimental data is used to validate the prediction performance of the combined model. The comparison of the experiment results indicates that combined model performs better than the individual model. The two-stage prediction of the combined model is characterized by high accuracy, fast speed, and robustness and can be applied to other complex machining error predictions.",

We performed meta-analysis to gather more evidence regarding clinical-molecular subgroups associated with better overall survival (OS) in advanced melanoma treated with checkpoint inhibitors.

A total of 6 clinical trials were eligible for the meta-analysis. OS was prolonged in wild BRAF subgroup (HR 0.65, 95% CI 0.49-0.85, p 0.002), Programmed cell death subgroup (PD-1+) (HR 0.57, 95% CI 0.41-0.80, p 0.001), and high lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level subgroup (HR 0.60, 95% CI 0.38-0.95, p 0.03).

Taking a cognition-based perspective, the present study investigated the genetic basis for both the divergent and the convergent thinking components of creativity. A total of 321 Chinese university students were recruited to complete the Guildford Unusual Using Test (UUT) for divergent thinking capability and the Remote Associates Test (RAT) for convergent thinking capability. The polymorphism of rs2576037 in KATNAL2 was related to the fluency and originality component scores of UUT, and the polymorphism of rs5993883 in COMT, rs362584 in SNAP25 was related to the RAT performance. These effects remained significant after considering the influence of age, gender and intelligence. Our results provide new evidence for the genetic basis of creativity and reveal the important role of gene polymorphisms in divergent and convergent thinking.",

Two wetting layer thicknesses of 0.5 and 2.0 nm were compared. A strong size dependence of P-to-S transition energy, transition dipole moment, oscillator strength, and linear and third-order nonlinear susceptibilities were concluded. The P-to-S transition dipole moment was shown to be purely in-plane polarization. The linear and nonlinear absorption and dispersion showed a red shift when the wetting layer thickness was increased. Our results revealed that the nonlinear susceptibility is much more sensitive to QD size compared to the linear susceptibility. An interpretation of the results was presented based on the probability density of finding the electron inside the dot and wetting layer. The results are in good agreement with previously reported experimental data.",

For oxide heterostructures, several different interfacial effects can dramatically change the nature of these instabilities. Here, we investigate LaAlO3\/SrTiO3 (001) heterostructures using synchrotron x-ray scattering. We find that when cooling from high temperature, LaAlO3 transforms from the Pm3\u00afm to the Imma phase due to strain. Furthermore, the first 4 unit cells of the film adjacent to the substrate exhibit a gradient in rotation angle that can couple with polar displacements in films thinner than that necessary for 2D electron gas formation.",

            "abstract": "In this work, we study characteristics of 14-nm-gate InGaAs-based trigate MOSFET (metal-oxide-semiconductor field effect transistor) devices with a channel capping layer. The impacts of thickness and gallium (Ga) concentration of the channel capping layer on the device characteristic are firstly simulated and optimized by using three-dimensional quantum-mechanically corrected device simulation. Devices with In1\u2212xGaxAs\/In0.53Ga0.47As channels have the large driving current owing to small energy band gap and low alloy scattering at the channel surface. By simultaneously considering various physical and switching properties, a 4-nm-thick In0.68Ga0.32As channel capping layer can be adopted for advanced applications. Under the optimized channel parameters, we further examine the effects of channel fin angle and the work-function fluctuation (WKF) resulting from nano-sized metal grains of NiSi gate on the characteristic degradation and variability. To maintain the device characteristics and achieve the minimal variation induced by WKF, the physical findings of this study indicate a critical channel fin angle of 85o is needed for the device with an averaged grain size of NiSi below 4x4 nm2.",

            "abstract": "<p>SWI\/SNF chromatin-modification complexes use the energy of ATP hydrolysis to remodel nucleosomes and to affect transcription and several cellular processes. Accordingly, their loss of function has been associated with malignant transformation. <i>ARID1A<\/i> (the expression of whose product, BAF250a, a key complex component, is lost when mutated) has recently been identified as a tumor suppressor gene that is mutated in 46-57% of ovarian clear cell carcinoma (CCC). The purposes of this study are to assess the frequency of loss of BAF250a expression in endometrial CCC and whether this loss has any discernable clinicopathologic implications. 34 endometrial carcinomas with a CCC component (including 22 pure CCC, 8 mixed carcinomas with a 10% CCC component, and 4 carcinosarcomas with a CCC epithelial component), were evaluated by immunohistochemistry using a monoclonal antibody directed against the human BAF250a protein. 5 (22.7%) of the 22 pure CCC were entirely BAF250a negative, whereas the remainder showed diffuse immunoreactivity. None of 4 carcinosarcomas and only 1 (12.5%) of the 8 mixed carcinomas were BAF250a negative. There was no discernable relationship between BAF250a immunoreactivity status and tumor architectural patterns (solid, papillary or tubulocystic areas) or cell type (flat, hobnail or polygonal). Of the 22 patients with pure CCC, 14, 2, 3, and 3 were International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stages 1, II, III and IV respectively. Interestingly, all 5 BAF250a negative cases were late stage [stages III or IV] as compared with 1 of 17 BAF250a positive cases (p=0.0002). Thus, 83% (5\/6) of all late stage cases were BAF250a [-], as compared with 0 (0%) of the 16 early stage (I or II) cases (p=.0002). BAF250a negative and positive cases did not show any statistically significant difference regarding patient age and frequency of lymphovascular invasion or myometrial invasion. As may be anticipated from the concentration of late stage cases in the BAF250a negative group, patient outcomes were worsened in that group on univariate analysis. In conclusion, we found in this pilot assessment that 22.7% of endometrial CCC displays complete loss of BAF250a expression. There was a disproportionate concentration of BAF250a negative cases in the late stage group, with the attendant possibility of an associated worsened prognosis for those CCC patients whose tumors are BAF250a negative. These preliminary findings suggest the need for larger analyses to evaluate the prognostic significance, if any, of the loss of BAF250a expression in this rare histotype of endometrial cancer.<\/p>",

            "abstract": "This work studies the correlation between secondary electron emission (SEE) characteristics and impulse surface flashover in polyethylene nanodielectrics both theoretically and experimentally, and illustrates the enhancement of flashover voltage in low-density polyethylene (LDPE) through incorporating Al2O3 nanoparticles. SEE characteristics play key roles in surface charging and gas desorption during surface flashover. This work demonstrates that the presence of Al2O3 nanoparticles decreases the SEE coefficient of LDPE and enhances the impact energy at the equilibrium state of surface charging. These changes can be explained by the increase of surface roughness and of surface ionization energy, and the strong interaction between nanoparticles and the polymer dielectric matrix. The surface charge and flashover voltage are calculated according to the secondary electron emission avalanche (SEEA) model, which reveals that the positive surface charges are reduced near the cathode triple point, while the presence of more nanoparticles in high loading samples enhances the gas desorption. Consequently, the surface flashover performance of LDPE\/Al2O3 nanodielectrics is improved.",

For this purpose we interviewed 125 competitors of both genders, year of birth 2002 and younger. Children were participating in the competitions for East and West League in the youngest category. Data were collected with a close-ended questionnaire. The acquired data were processed with SPSS software programme; frequencies were carried out. Mean age was 8.9 years. Most young athletes, 42.4%, attend competitions with the purpose of gaining new experience, followed by those whose main goal is good climbing. These are 40.8%. 14.4% attend competitions to achieve good result and 2.4% for reason of socializing. 19.2% of children don't care if they don't reach the top of the climbing route, but 80.8% are slightly to quite dissatisfied. The study shows that internal motivation is dominant in young climbers. Mostly they attend competitions to gain new experience and to show good climbing. If they don't reach the top of the climbing route, they leave competition unsatisfied. It would be reasonable to consider the study results in the organization of competitions for youngest categories.",

So far, the role of miRNAs in pregnancy-associated breast cancer (PABC) has not been investigated.<\/p><p><b>Methods and Results:<\/b> We evaluated miR-21 expression by quantitative RT-PCR in 35 patients, 25 with PABC and 10 control breast cancer cases not pregnancy-associated with similar clinicopathological features. We then analyzed protein expression for PTEN, BCL2 and PDCD4 as miR-21 target genes by IHC, and finally correlated the results with patients' clinicopathological features.<\/p><p>Significant overexpression of miR-21 in PABC tumors compared to normal adjacent tissue was found. Overexpression of miR-21 was frequently found in high grade tumors with loss of hormone receptor expression and was significantly associated with positive lymph nodes (p=0.025). In PABC patients, PTEN, BCL2 and PDCD4 target protein expression was decreased in 80%, 76% and 40% respectively.<\/p><p><b>Conclusion<\/b>: Our study supports the involvement of miR-21 in breast cancer progression and metastasis formation in PABC implying a role of this miRNA as a marker for poor prognosis in PABC patients.<\/p>",

Upon dynamic loading, there exist largely scattered fracture strengths even if the strain rates are under the same order, and the BMG systems are the same. The negative strain rate dependence for La- and Mg-based BMGs is obtained, i.e., a decreased fracture strength is dominating from quasi-static to dynamic compression. At cryogenic temperatures, distinguishingly low fracture strengths are available for these two brittle BMGs, and decreased tolerance to accommodate strains makes BMGs more and more brittle. It is concluded that the scattering mechanical performances of brittle BMGs should be carefully evaluated before actual applications.\n         ",

We give a quantitative criterion for the appearance of deaf Bloch waves, which are antisymmetric with respect to a symmetry axis of the phononic crystal, in the frame of generalized Fresnel formulas for reflection and transmission at the phononic crystal boundary. This criterion is used to index Bloch waves in the complex band structure of the phononic crystal, for directions of incidence along a symmetry axis. We argue that within deaf frequency ranges transmission is multi-exponential, as it is within frequency band gaps.",

The effect of the curvature-induced orbital hybridization on the electronic properties of CNTs, however, has not been evaluated quantitatively. In this study, the strength of orbital hybridization in CNTs under homogeneous radial strain was evaluated quantitatively. Our analyses revealed the detailed procedure of the change in electronic structure of CNTs. In addition, the dihedral angle, the angle between \u03c0-orbital axis vectors of adjacent atoms, was found to effectively predict the strength of local orbital hybridization in deformed CNTs.",

Evidence of nucleation was not seen in the bulk metallic glass loaded gels, however, the PEDOT:PSS loaded gels produced charge storage capacities over 15 mC\/cm2 when sufficient polymer was loaded. These studies support the hypothesis that secondary nucleation is an efficient approach to producing stand-alone conducting hydrogels.\n         ",

The aim of this study was to assess the antifungal effects of acrylic resins containing silver nanoparticles on candida Albicans.Materials & Methods: To accomplish this in vitro study inorder to prepare acrylic samples, metallic cylindricals with a diameter of 10mm and thickness of 4mm were used. Forty samples as standard control group and 40 samples containing silver nanoparticles in four different concentrations were used. Immersion of samples in fungal suspension (standard and hospitally isolated) were carried out to accomplish antifungal tests. After 0,1,6 and 24 hours the fungal colonies were counted. To describe the data and to compare groups, student-t test was used.Results: In the silver nanoparticles with 2.5% concentration, the highest mean difference for standard candida Albicans after 24 hours of exposure time was 501.0\u00b123.1 and for 5% concentration after 6 hours of exposure time was 953\u00b187 and for 10% concentration after 6 hours of exposure time was 1000\u00b124.9.Conclusion: In acrylic resins, increasing both the silver nanoparticles concentration and the exposure time will increase the antifungal effect.

            "abstract": "Carole SourbierRockville, MD, USAAbstract: With about 22,000 new cases estimated in 2012 in the US and 15,500 related deaths, ovarian cancer is a heterogeneous and aggressive disease. Even though most of patients are sensitive to chemotherapy treatment following surgery, recurring disease is almost always lethal, and only about 30% of the women affected will be cured. Thanks to a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying ovarian cancer malignancy, new therapeutic options with molecular-targeted agents have become available. This review discusses the rationale behind molecular-targeted therapies and examines how newly identified molecular targets may enhance personalized therapies for ovarian cancer patients.

            "abstract": "The solar corona and chromosphere are often marked by eruptive features, such as \ufb02ares, prominences, loops, and coronal mass ejections, which rise above the photospheric surface. Coronal streamers and plumes can also characterize the outer atmosphere of the Sun. All of these structures, fascinating in their extent and formation, frequently emit continuous spectra and can usually be observed using white-light coronagraphs. This implies, at least in part, that they are comprised of condensed matter. The continuous spectra associated with chromospheric and coronal structures can be viewed as representing the twenty-eighth line of evidence, and the eighth Planckian proof, that the Sun is condensed matter. The existence of such objects also suggests that the density of the solar atmosphere rises to levels well in excess of current estimates put forth by the gaseous models of the Sun. In this work, the densities of planetary atmospheres are examined in order to gain insight relative to the likely densities of the solar chromosphere. Elevated densities in the solar atmosphere are also supported by coronal seismology studies, which can be viewed as constituting the twenty-ninth line of evidence that the Sun is composed of condensed matter.",

O plantio das sementes deu-se em vasos com capacidade de 12 kg, contendo como substrato um Argissolo e uma planta por vaso. O experimento obedeceu a um delineamento experimental inteiramente casualizado, em esquema fatorial 5 x 2, com quatro repeti\u00e7\u00f5es, referentes a cinco concentra\u00e7\u00f5es de biofertilizante: C1 = 50% bio + 50% \u00e1gua (1:1), C2 = 33,33% bio + 66,67 \u00e1gua (1:2), C3 = 25% bio + 75% \u00e1gua (1:3), C4 = 20% bio + 80% \u00e1gua (1:4) e C5 = 11,12+ 88,88% \u00e1gua (1:5) e dois n\u00edveis de salinidade para a \u00e1gua de irriga\u00e7\u00e3o S1 = 0,8 dS m-1 (baixa salinidade) e S2 = 3,4 dS m-1 (alta salinidade). Foram analisadas a condutividade el\u00e9trica do solo (CEes) e o crescimento inicial das plantas utilizando-se as seguintes caracter\u00edsticas: altura de plantas, di\u00e2metro do colmo, \u00e1rea foliar, mat\u00e9ria seca da parte a\u00e9rea, da raiz e mat\u00e9ria seca total. A irriga\u00e7\u00e3o com \u00e1gua de baixa salinidade foi mais eficiente no crescimento inicial das plantas, exceto a mat\u00e9ria seca da raiz, sob concentra\u00e7\u00f5es crescentes de biofertilizante bovino.

The experiment was conducted in a greenhouse of the Department of Soil Science - UFC. The seeds were planted in vessels with a 12 kg capacity, containing Alfissol as substrate and one plant per pot. The experiment followed a completely randomized design, in a 5x2 factorial scheme, with four replications, referring to five concentrations of bio-fertilizer: C1 = 50% biofertilizer + 50% water (1:1), C2 = 33.33% biofertilizer + 66.67 + water (1:2), C3 = 25% biofertilizer + 75% water (1:3), C4 = 20% biofertilizer + 80% water (1:4) and C5 = 11.12% biofertilizer + 88, 88% water (1:5) and two salinity levels of irrigation water for S1 = 0.8 dS m-1 (low salinity) and S2 = 3.4 dS m-1 (high salinity). We analyzed the early growth of plants as compared to the readings of electrical conductivity of water saturated soil extracts (ECse) by using the collected data on plant height, stem diameter, leaf area, shoot dry matter, root dry matter and total dry matter. Irrigation with low salinity water was found more efficient in promoting the initial growth of plants under increasing concentrations of biofertilizer, except for root dry matter. Under the same concentrations of biofertilizer, plus irrigation with saline water, soil salinity increased, but did so with less intensity in soil irrigated with low salinity water.",

            "abstract": "There is a growing recognition of the need for daily contact with nature, to live happy, productive, meaningful lives. Recent attention to biophilic design among architects and designers acknowledges this power of nature. However, in an increasingly urban planet, more attention needs to be aimed at the urban scales, at planning for and moving towards what the authors call \u201cbiophilic cities\u201d. Biophilic cities are cities that provide close and daily contact with nature, nearby nature, but also seek to foster an awareness of and caring for this nature. Biophilic cities, it is argued here, are also sustainable and resilient cities. Achieving the conditions of a biophilic city will go far in helping to foster social and landscape resilience, in the face of climate change, natural disasters and economic uncertainty and various other shocks that cities will face in the future. The paper identifies key pathways by which biophilic urbanism enhances resilience, and while some are well-established relationships, others are more tentative and suggest future research and testing.",

            "abstract": "The influence of second-generation products on the particle mass yield of <i>&beta;<\/i>-caryophyllene ozonolysis was systematically tested and quantified. The approach was to vary the relative concentrations of first- and second-generation products by adjusting the concentration of ozone while observing changes in particle mass yield. For all wall-loss corrected organic particle mass concentrations <i>M<\/i><sub>org<\/sub> of this study (0.5 < <i>M<\/i><sub>org<\/sub> < 230 \u03bcg m<sup>\u22123<\/sup>), the data show that the particle-phase organic material was composed for the most part of second-generation products. For 0.5< <i>M<\/i><sub>org<\/sub> < 10 \u03bcg m<sup>\u22123<\/sup>, a range which overlaps with atmospheric concentrations, the particle mass yield was 10 to 20% and was not sensitive to ozone exposure, implying that the constituent molecules were rapidly produced at all investigated ozone exposures. In contrast, for <i>M<\/i><sub>org<\/sub> > 10 \u03bcg m<sup>\u22123<\/sup> the particle mass yield increased to as high as 70% for the ultimate yield corresponding to the greatest ozone exposures. These differing dependencies on ozone exposure under different regimes of <i>M<\/i><sub>org<\/sub> are explained by a combination of the ozonolysis lifetimes of the first-generation products and the volatility distribution of the resulting second-generation products. First-generation products that have short lifetimes produce low-volatility second-generation products whereas first-generation products that have long lifetimes produce high-volatility second-generation products. The ultimate particle mass yield was defined by mass-based stoichiometric yields <i>&alpha;<\/i><sub><i>i<\/i><\/sub> of <i>&alpha;<\/i><sub>0<\/sub> = 0.17 \u00b1 0.05, <i>&alpha;<\/i><sub>1<\/sub> = 0.11 \u00b1 0.17, and <i>&alpha;<\/i><sub>2<\/sub> = 1.03 \u00b1 0.30 for corresponding saturation concentrations of 1, 10, and 100 \u03bcg m<sup>\u22123<\/sup>. Terms <i>&alpha;<\/i><sub>0<\/sub> and <i>&alpha;<\/i><sub>1<\/sub> had low sensitivity to the investigated range of ozone exposure whereas term <i>&alpha;<\/i><sub>2<\/sub> increased from 0.32 \u00b1 0.13 to 1.03 \u00b1 0.30 as the ozone exposure was increased. These findings potentially allow for simplified yet accurate parameterizations in air quality and climate models that seek to represent the ozonolysis particle mass yields of certain classes of biogenic compounds.",

A 2-month-old male infant presented with a diffuse swelling in the parotid region since birth that was gradually increasing in size. The ultrasonography (USG) report was suggestive of a right intraparotid mass of uncertain etiology; whereas magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) report inclined toward a mass associated with chronic inflammatory pathology. Fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) suggested two differentials - a vascular neoplasm of the parotid gland and a spindle cell neoplasm with increased vascularity. The lesion was reaspirated and a cell button was constructed from the aspirated material to reach a conclusive diagnosis by histopathological evaluation and immunohistochemistry (IHC) before attempting any intervention to treat the infant. The final diagnosis after histopathological and IHC studies was given as deep cellular intraparotid hemangioma. Subsequently, the patient was treated with single sitting bleomycin sclerotherapy. A simple technique of cell button resulted in sparing of hospitalization and surgical procedure in the infant.",

            "title": "Proposed correlation of modern processing principles for Ayurvedic herbal drug manufacturing: A systematic review",
            "abstract": "Quality Ayurvedic herbal medicines are potential, low-cost solutions for addressing contemporary healthcare needs of both Indian and global community. Correlating Ayurvedic herbal preparations with modern processing principles (MPPs) can help develop new and use appropriate technology for scaling up production of the medicines, which is necessary to meet the growing demand. Understanding the fundamental Ayurvedic principles behind formulation and processing is also important for improving the dosage forms. Even though Ayurvedic industry has adopted technologies from food, chemical and pharmaceutical industries, there is no systematic study to correlate the traditional and modern processing methods. This study is an attempt to provide a possible correlation between the Ayurvedic processing methods and MPPs. A systematic literature review was performed to identify the Ayurvedic processing methods by collecting information from English editions of classical Ayurveda texts on medicine preparation methods. Correlation between traditional and MPPs was done based on the techniques used in Ayurvedic drug processing. It was observed that in Ayurvedic medicine preparations there were two major types of processes, namely extraction, and separation. Extraction uses membrane rupturing and solute diffusion principles, while separation uses volatility, adsorption, and size-exclusion principles. The study provides systematic documentation of methods used in Ayurveda for herbal drug preparation along with its interpretation in terms of MPPs. This is the first step which can enable improving or replacing traditional techniques. New technologies or use of existing technologies can be used to improve the dosage forms and scaling up while maintaining the Ayurvedic principles similar to traditional techniques.",

Using analytical tools stemming from research of education and history didactics we highlight problematic differences between universities. It is evident that history education in many ways lacks a progression from upper secondary school to higher education. Judging from the formulations in the syllabuses, the grading demands on the students in upper secondary schools are in some cases even higher than in the universities. The results from this study suggest a need for further analysis of the teaching of history, and other subjects, in higher education in relation to teaching in upper secondary schools.",

The blend is processed through various extrusion methods aimed to improve clay dispersion. The UL94 method in vertical position, oxygen index and cone calorimetric measurements assess HIPS blend behavior in combustion. TGA, FTIR, SEM and X-ray measurements, together with mechanical and rheological tests evaluate the thermal degradation, morphology, intercalation and degree of dispersion of particles. The use of a static-mixing die placed at the extreme of a single screw extruder improves clay platelets distribution and reduces the peak heat release rate better than employing a twin screw extrusion process. In addition, mechanical and rheological properties are affected substantially by changing the extrusion process. A correlation between clay dispersion and HIPS fire retardant properties is found, as the peak heat release rate decreases with good clay dispersion in cone calorimetric tests. ",

This article focuses on considerations for ixabepilone administration and adverse event (AE) management, drawing from the biomedical literature indexed in PubMed, published abstracts from the American Society of Clinical Oncology annual meetings, and the manufacturer&amp;rsquo;s prescribing information for ixabepilone. Administered as monotherapy or in combination with capecitabine in clinical studies, ixabepilone demonstrated positive clinical response rates, prolonged progression-free survival, and a favorable safety profile in patients with MBC. Treatment-related AEs were predictable and manageable with dose modification, treatment interruption, and active management. As ixabepilone undergoes development in earlier lines of breast cancer therapy and in other solid tumors, oncology nurses will encounter more and more patients receiving ixabepilone therapy. If nurses are acquainted with the unique management strategies associated with ixabepilone treatment, as detailed herein, patients are more likely to receive the full benefit of therapy.

            "abstract": "Background & objectives: Lipoprotein associated phospholipase A 2 (Lp-PLA 2 ) is an important risk predictor of coronary artery disease (CAD). This study was aimed to evaluate Lp-PLA 2 activity and oxidized low density lipoprotein (oxLDL) in newly diagnosed patients of type 2 diabetes mellitus and to determine the correlation of Lp-PLA 2 activity with oxLDL and plasma glucose levels. \n Methods: Blood samples were collected in patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes (n=40) before any treatment was started and healthy controls (n=40). These were processed for estimating plasma glucose: fasting and post prandial, ox LDL, and Lp-PLA2 activity. The parameters in the two groups were compared. Correlation between different parameters was calculated by Pearson correlation analysis in both groups.\n Results: Lp-PLA 2 activity (24.48 \u00b1 4.91 vs 18.63 \u00b1 5.29 nmol\/min\/ml, P<0.001) and oxLDL levels (52.46 \u00b1 40.19 vs 33.26 \u00b1 12.54 \u03bcmol\/l, P<0.01) were significantly higher in patients as compared to those in controls. Lp-PLA 2 activity correlated positively with oxLDL in both controls (r=0.414, P<0.01), as well in patients (r=0.542, P<0.01). A positive correlation between Lp-PLA 2 activity and fasting plasma glucose levels was observed only in patients (r=0.348, P<0.05). \nInterpretation & conclusions: Result of this study implies that higher risk of CAD in patients with diabetes may be due to increase in Lp-PLA 2 activity during the early course of the disease. A positive correlation between enzyme activity and fasting plasma glucose indicates an association between hyperglycaemia and increased activity of Lp-PLA2. This may explain a higher occurrence of CAD in patients with diabetes. A positive correlation between oxLDL and Lp-PLA2 activity suggests that Lp-PLA2 activity may be affected by oxLDL also.",

The paper addresses community concerns on service quality. It focuses on the poor because they are a vulnerable group and often bear a huge burden of disease. Community views were solicited and obtained using eight focus group discussions, six in-depth and 12 key informant interviews. User perceptions and definitions of the quality of health services depended on a number of variables related to technical competence, accessibility to services, interpersonal relations and presence of adequate drugs, supplies, staff, and facility amenities. Results indicate that service delivery to the poor in the general population is perceived to be of low quality. The factors that were mentioned as affecting the quality of services delivered were inadequate trained health workers, shortage of essential drugs, poor attitude of the health workers, and long distances to health facilities. This paper argues that there should be an improvement in the quality of health services with particular attention being paid to the poor. Despite wide focus on improvement of the existing infrastructure and donor funding, there is still low satisfaction with health services and poor perceived accessibility.Keywords: quality, health care, poor, community, perceptions, utilization ",

M\u00c9TODOS: Estudo anal\u00edtico transversal com um grupo controle no qual foram inclu\u00eddas crian\u00e7as de 8 a 12 anos com diagn\u00f3stico cl\u00ednico otorrinolaringol\u00f3gico de RB, recrutadas do Ambulat\u00f3rio do Respirador Bucal do Hospital de Cl\u00ednicas da Universidade Estadual de Campinas, Campinas (SP), entre outubro de 2010 e janeiro de 2011. Os crit\u00e9rios de exclus\u00e3o foram obesidade, asma, doen\u00e7as respirat\u00f3rias cr\u00f4nicas, cardiopatias e dist\u00farbios neurol\u00f3gicos ou ortop\u00e9dicos.

RESULTADOS: Das 92 crian\u00e7as do estudo, 30 tinham RB e 62 tinham RN. No grupo RB, n\u00e3o houve diferen\u00e7as nas m\u00e9dias de PIm\u00e1x, PEm\u00e1x e dist\u00e2ncia percorrida pelo TC6 (DTC6) entre o grupo com AC classificada como grave ou moderada e aquele com AC normal (p = 0,622; p = 0,957; e p = 0,079, respectivamente). No grupo RN, as m\u00e9dias de PIm\u00e1x e PEm\u00e1x foram maiores no grupo com AC moderada do que naquele com AC normal (p = 0,003 e p = 0,004, respectivamente). Os valores de PIm\u00e1x, PEm\u00e1x e DTC6 foram menores no grupo RB do que no grupo RN. A presen\u00e7a de AC moderada determinou maiores valores de PIm\u00e1x e PEm\u00e1x. CONCLUS\u00d5ES: A RB afetou negativamente a biomec\u00e2nica respirat\u00f3ria e a capacidade de exerc\u00edcio. A presen\u00e7a de AC moderada atuou como um mecanismo de compensa\u00e7\u00e3o para uma melhor fun\u00e7\u00e3o da musculatura respirat\u00f3ria.<br>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate submaximal exercise tolerance and respiratory muscle strength in relation to forward head posture (FHP) and respiratory mode in children, comparing mouth-breathing (MB) children with nasal-breathing (NB) children. METHODS: This was a controlled, analytical cross-sectional study involving children in the 8-12 year age bracket with a clinical otorhinolaryngology diagnosis of MB, recruited between October of 2010 and January of 2011 from the Mouth Breather Clinic at the State University of Campinas Hospital de Cl\u00ednicas, located in the city of Campinas, Brazil. The exclusion criteria were obesity, asthma, chronic respiratory diseases, heart disease, and neurological or orthopedic disorders. All of the participants underwent postural assessment and the six-minute walk test (6MWT), together with determination of MIP and MEP. RESULTS: Of the 92 children in the study, 30 presented with MB and 62 presented with NB. In the MB group, the differences between those with moderate or severe FHP and those with normal head posture, in terms of the mean MIP, MEP and six-minute walk distance (6MWD), were not significant (p = 0.079, p = 0.622, and p = 0.957, respectively). In the NB group, the mean values of MIP and MEP were higher in the children with moderate FHP than in those with normal head posture (p = 0.003 and p = 0.004, respectively). The mean MIP, MEP, and 6MWD were lower in the MB group than in the NB group. Values of MIP and MEP were highest in the children with moderate FHP. CONCLUSIONS: Respiratory biomechanics and exercise capacity were negatively affected by MB. The presence of moderate FHP acted as a compensatory mechanism in order to improve respiratory muscle function.",

            "abstract": "OBJETIVO: Describir la mortalidad en M\u00e9xico por defectos del tubo neural, durante el periodo 1980-1997. MATERIAL Y M\u00c9TODOS: Las tasas anuales de mortalidad estatales y nacionales, por defectos del tubo neural, se calcularon por 10 000 nacidos vivos. La tendencia temporal fue evaluada por el porcentaje de cambio anual obtenido mediante un modelo de regresi\u00f3n de Poisson. Se calcul\u00f3 la raz\u00f3n de mortalidad, tomando la media nacional como referencia. Las tasas y las razones se representaron gr\u00e1ficamente en mapas. RESULTADOS: Durante el periodo la tasa bruta de mortalidad por defectos del tubo neural fue de 5.8 por 10 000 nacidos vivos. La anencefalia fue el tipo de defecto m\u00e1s frecuente (37.7%), seguida de la espina b\u00edfida sin hidrocefalia (31.6%). La tendencia nacional de la mortalidad por defectos del tubo neural fue ascendente entre 1980 y 1990 (porcentaje de cambio anual 7.5 IC 95% 6.5, 8.6) y descendente entre 1990-1997 (porcentaje de cambio anual -2.3 IC 95% -3.6, -0.9). CONCLUSIONES: Las altas tasas de mortalidad por defectos del tubo neural fueron debidas principalmente a la elevada frecuencia de las anencefalias. El incremento observado parece no ser s\u00f3lo atribuible a cuestiones puramente diagn\u00f3sticas o de mejora en los registros. La influencia de factores asociados a estos defectos, como determinados polimorfismos gen\u00e9ticos, la deficiencia de \u00e1cido f\u00f3lico, la obesidad materna, la exposici\u00f3n laboral a plaguicidas y la pobreza deber\u00e1n evaluarse mediante estudios espec\u00edficos.",

            "abstract": "Many retirees from the United States of America have limited health insurance coverage while living in Mexico. Medicare and Medicaid benefits are not portable to other countries and Medigap (private insurance that supplements Medicare) is very limited. This causes economic and medical hardships and serves as a barrier to retirement to Mexico. Increasing numbers of U.S. retirees will be interested in moving to Mexico in the future because of the climate, the culture, and the lower cost of living. The numbers are increasing as a result of several factors such as aging \"baby boomers\" and the rapidly growing Mexican-origin population in the U.S.A. who are citizens or permanent residents but would like to return to their communities of origin after working in the U.S.A. There are several policy initiatives that could provide opportunities for improving health insurance coverage for these retirees that could be cost-effective. The full version of this paper is available too at: http:\/\/www.insp.mx\/salud\/index.html<br>Muchos jubilados estadunidenses cuentan con una cobertura de seguro m\u00e9dico restringida mientras viven en M\u00e9xico. Los beneficios de Medicare y Medicaid no son transferibles a otros pa\u00edses, y el Medigap (el seguro privado que complementa a Medicare) es muy limitado. Esto genera privaciones econ\u00f3micas y m\u00e9dicas y es una barrera para el retiro en M\u00e9xico. Un n\u00famero creciente de jubilados estadunidenses estar\u00eda interesado en mudarse a M\u00e9xico en el futuro, debido al clima, la cultura y el costo m\u00e1s bajo de la vida. Este n\u00famero creciente es resultado de varios factores: el envejecimiento de los baby boomers y la creciente poblaci\u00f3n de origen mexicano con ciudadan\u00eda estadunidense o con residencia permanente, a la que le gustar\u00eda regresar a su comunidad de origen despu\u00e9s de haber trabajado en Estados Unidos de Am\u00e9rica. En este trabajo se presentan diversas iniciativas que podr\u00edan ofrecer oportunidades para mejorar la cobertura de seguro m\u00e9dico para los retirados y que, adem\u00e1s, podr\u00edan ser costo-efectivas.

Three diets, which consisted of commercial feed (40% crude protein), dried duckweed or a combination of commercial feed and dried duckweed were fed to triplicate groups of 20 tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) fingerlings. Fish weighing 3.2 \u00b1 0.94g were stocked in nine 1-m3 net cages and fed twice a day for 50 days. The final average weights of fingerlings fed commercial feed (21.67g) and50% feed + 50% dried duckweed (19.53g) were not different (p<0.05). Likewise, the specific growth rate did not differ between fish receiving these dietary treatments. Weight gain decreased as water temperature decreased along the experimental period, increasing feed conversion mainly for fingerlings fed on dried duckweed only. Also, when fed alone dried duckweed promoted the lowest weight gain and specific growth rate. It was confirmed that dried duckweed can replace 50% (1:1 dry weight) tilapia fingerling 40% crude protein feed for a period of at least 50 days, without reducing growth.",

We report on a case of reactivation of Chagas' disease in a patient with meningoencephalitis during chemotherapy for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma without any relation to hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation and with late detection of Trypanosoma cruzi in blood and cerebrospinal fluid. Despite specific treatment with benznidazole, the patient died 8 days later. High clinical suspicion and sensitive diagnostic methods are fundamental for early diagnosis and initiation of treatment in order to minimize mortality.",

            "abstract": "Developmental malformations are brain abnormalities that occur during embryogenesis. Neuronal migration disorders, including heterotopic lesions, constitute one type of such abnormalities. The aim of the study was to compare the epileptic clinical patterns of patients with periventricular nodular heterotopia (PNH) (G1) with those affected by subcortical heterotopia (SCH) (G2) looking for differences between both groups which, eventually, might suggest the type of the underlying malformation. The variables studied in both groups were: type of the heterotopia depicted on MRI studies, sex, age, age at seizure onset, annual seizure frequency, localization of the ictal symptomatogenic zone, characteristics of the EEG, other associated anomalies on the magnetic resonance images (MRI) besides the heterotopia, and response to treatment. The only difference found between both groups was the type of heterotopia as shown by MRI studies. The other assessed variables did not significantly (p>0.05) differ between groups. No differences in the clinical features characterizing epilepsy could be found in patients with PNH or SCH, being the images the only tool able to differentiate them.<br>Las malformaciones de la corteza cerebral son un grupo de entidades que se producen durante las etapas del desarrollo embrionario y cuya manifestaci\u00f3n cl\u00ednica puede ser la epilepsia. Estas malformaciones pueden ser diagnosticadas in vivo a trav\u00e9s de las im\u00e1genes por resonancia magn\u00e9tica (IRM). Un subtipo particular de \u00e9stas lo constituyen los trastornos en la migraci\u00f3n neuronal, dentro de los cuales se ubican las heterotop\u00edas (HT). El objetivo del estudio fue comparar enfermos portadores de HT periventriculares (G1) con aquellos portadores de HT subcorticales (G2). Se analizaron las variables sexo, edad y edad de inicio de la epilepsia (EI) en a\u00f1os, antecedentes familiares (AF) o prenatales (AP), frecuencia anual de crisis (FAC) y caracter\u00edsticas semiol\u00f3gicas de las crisis, hallazgos en el EEG e IRM y respuesta al tratamiento farmacol\u00f3gico. G1 (n=13): 8 mujeres (61.5%), edad promedio 32.9 \u00b1 11.5 (rango 20-59), EI 13.7 \u00b1 7.6 (rango 2-23), AF 1 caso (7.7%), AP en 1 (7.7%), FAC 28.3 \u00b1 31.4 (rango 0-120), crisis multifocales en 5 (38.5%), crisis temporales en 5 pacientes (38.5%), EEG epileptiforme (EEGE) en 7 casos (53.8%), anomal\u00edas asociadas en las IRM (AAIRM) en 8 sujetos (61.5%) y 4 casos refractarios al tratamiento (30.7%). G2 (n=8): 6 mujeres (75%), edad promedio 30 \u00b1 9.7 (rango 13-43), EI 11.1 \u00b1 6.3 (rango 1-19), AP 2 (25%), FAC 30 \u00b1 39.5 (rango 0-120), crisis multifocales en 4 sujetos (50%), crisis temporales en 5 pacientes (62.5%), EEGE en 7 casos (87.5%), AAIRM en 3 casos (37.5%) y 1 caso refractario al tratamiento (12.5%).

            "abstract": "Developmental malformations are brain abnormalities that occur during embryogenesis. Neuronal migration disorders, including heterotopic lesions, constitute one type of such abnormalities. The aim of the study was to compare the epileptic clinical patterns of patients with periventricular nodular heterotopia (PNH) (G1) with those affected by subcortical heterotopia (SCH) (G2) looking for differences between both groups which, eventually, might suggest the type of the underlying malformation. The variables studied in both groups were: type of the heterotopia depicted on MRI studies, sex, age, age at seizure onset, annual seizure frequency, localization of the ictal symptomatogenic zone, characteristics of the EEG, other associated anomalies on the magnetic resonance images (MRI) besides the heterotopia, and response to treatment. The only difference found between both groups was the type of heterotopia as shown by MRI studies. The other assessed variables did not significantly (p>0.05) differ between groups. No differences in the clinical features characterizing epilepsy could be found in patients with PNH or SCH, being the images the only tool able to differentiate them.<br>Las malformaciones de la corteza cerebral son un grupo de entidades que se producen durante las etapas del desarrollo embrionario y cuya manifestaci\u00f3n cl\u00ednica puede ser la epilepsia.

            "abstract": "Genetic markers, from morphological to molecular, in function with early  indicators of tolerance toward drought, have been an object of research and  scientific papers for many years. It starts with the hypothesis that  seedlings produced from seeds that were collected from population of  extremely different site conditions, on the level of open pollinated  families, will have different results concerning drought tolerance. By  tracking the dynamics of germination and morphological parameters of  saplings, we are researching the interdependence of these parameters with the  survival and growth of two-year-old seedlings in conditions where there is a  lack of water. Austrian Pine seeds were collected from forty trees,  distributed over five provenances on the Balkan Peninsula. Within each  provenance a group is assigned to an extremely harsh and dry habitat, while  also another group is assigned to prosperous (the most productive) habitat.  The analysis of the twenty-one-day-old seedlings (saplings) is performed in  the laboratory, while the tolerance test of the two-year-old seedlings is  performed in the field. Seedlings that are exposed to conditions in which  there is lack of water, have the coefficient of water formation evaluation  22.59 times bigger than sandy-clay soil with fraction of sand bigger than 60  percent. The results show significant and positive correlation between some  parameters of saplings and the dynamics of growth (high increments) of the  seedlings in drought, but no correlation with the survival of the seedlings.",

Newly-hatched larvae were obtained by stripping of hormonally induced broodstock, and were stocked in 32-liter tanks at densities from 30 to 50 L-1. Four experiments were carried out testing six light intensities: 50, 100, 200, 500, 1500, and 2500 lx, and total darkness as a control. Mean survival ranged from 0.06 to 16.0% and were significantly influenced by light intensity. Complete darkness resulted in 100% mortality after one week, larvae appeared to have starved since they had empty stomachs. The species has the characteristics of a visual-feeder. Survival was the highest at 200 lx, while at 500 lx was higher than at 50, 100, and 2500 lx. Frequency of functional swim bladder ranged from 36.8 to 100%, but it was not significantly correlated with light intensity. Based on this study, a medium light intensity, 200 to 1500 lx, is recommended for rearing fat snook larvae. Extreme values must be avoided, mainly in the first two weeks after hatching.<br>Diferentes intensidades de luz foram testadas na larvicultura do robalo peva, Centropomus parallelus, avaliando sua influ\u00eancia na sobreviv\u00eancia e insufla\u00e7\u00e3o da bexiga gasosa.

In terms of body proportions, no latitudinal gradients were evident, but a few local \"morphotypes\" could be distinguished. The distinctive egg mass morphology, and size and form features, including a hectocotylus 20-40% longer than the opposing ventral arm and the presence of suckers on the buccal membrane, indicated that Lolliguncula from northern and southern hemispheres might comprise two different taxa.<br>A variabilidade morfol\u00f3gica e morfom\u00e9trica do pequeno loligin\u00eddeo costeiro Lolliguncula brevis foi avaliada ao longo da maior parte de sua amplitude latitudinal no hemisf\u00e9rio sul, ao longo da costa brasileira (8\u00ba S - 27\u00ba S).

Este trabalho visou investigar a capacidade de regenera\u00e7\u00e3o de plantas do Maring\u00e1 e duas linhas isog\u00eanicas com um e dois genes de estatura reduzida (Rht1 e Rht2). Foram utilizados embri\u00f5es imaturos de Maring\u00e1, das linhas isog\u00eanicas e das F2's dos cruzamentos entre estes gen\u00f3tipos, que foram colocados em meio de cultura MS modificado (MILACH et al., 1991) com sacarose, \u00e1gar e doses decrescentes de 2,4D conforme a etapa de cultivo (2mg\/l; 0,5mg\/l; 0,1mg\/l e sem 2,4D). Tamb\u00e9m foi avaliada a possibilidade de supress\u00e3o de um subcultivo, quando os calos n\u00e3o passariam pelo meio com 0,1mg\/l de 2,4D. As an\u00e1lises estat\u00edsticas demonstraram que os gen\u00f3tipos diferiram quanto \u00e0 regenera\u00e7\u00e3o de plantas, evidenciando a influ\u00eancia do gene Rht, que reduziu o n\u00famero de plantas regeneradas por calo. A retirada do meio com 0,1mg\/l de 2,4D n\u00e3o alterou a regenera\u00e7\u00e3o, podendo-se eliminar esta etapa de cultivo. Os gen\u00f3tipos responderam da mesma forma nas diferentes sequ\u00eancias de subcultivo, n\u00e3o havendo intera\u00e7\u00e3o entre estes dois caracteres.<br>Different genotypes show different responses for in vitro plant regeneration. In previous work with lhe Maring\u00e1 genotype a result of 100% of in vitro plant regeneration was obtained. The purpose of this study was to investigate the capacity of plant regeneration of Maring\u00e1 genotype and two of it's isogenic lines with one and two shorts heigth genes (Rht1 and Rht2). Imature embryos from: (a) Maring\u00e1, (b) the isogenic lines and (c) the crosses between these genotypes were placed on MS medium (modified by MILACH et al., 1991) with saccharose, agar and decreasing doses of 2,4D (2mg\/l; 0.5mg\/l; 0.1mg\/l and 0.0mg\/l) according to the stage of culture. The possibility of suppressing one of the stages of culture, (which uses 0.1mg\/1 of 2.4D) was also evaluated. The statistic analisys demonstrated that the different genotypes gave different responses, therefore this indicates that the Rht genes had influence on plant regeneration rates. The suppression of the stage of culture which uses 0.1mg\/l of 2,4D did not have any influence on regeneration, showing that this stage can be eliminated. Different genotypes had the same responses on the different culture medium sequences. The intercection between genotype x medium was not significam.",

A ocorr\u00eancia de podrid\u00f5es n\u00e3o diferiu entre p\u00eassegos hidrorresfriados e controles no armazenamento, nas duas cultivares, mas foram maiores no tratamento-controle, no amadurecimento na 'Chimarrita'. A firmeza da polpa foi igual entre os tratamentos na 'Chimarrita' e superior nos p\u00eassegos 'Chirip\u00e1' hidrorresfriados durante a armazenagem. No amadurecimento a 20&deg;C, a firmeza de polpa de ambas as cultivares decresceu a valores semelhantes nos frutos-controle e nos hidrorresfriados. Ap\u00f3s 21 dias em frio, 50% dos p\u00eassegos da cv. Chirip\u00e1 e 15% dos p\u00eassegos da cv. Chimarrita, de ambos os tratamentos, apresentaram lanosidade. O dist\u00farbio reten\u00e7\u00e3o de firmeza ocorreu em 20% dos p\u00eassegos 'Chirip\u00e1' e em 50% dos 'Chimarrita'.<br>In the present work the effects of hydro cooling on the quality of 'Chimarrita' and 'Chirip\u00e1' peaches were evaluated. Peaches were hydro cooled by immersion in water at 5\u00baC with flesh temperatures monitored for 3 minutes and thereafter stored at 0\u00baC ('Chirip\u00e1') or 0,5\u00baC ('Chimarrita') for 7, 14 or 21 days. Samples were evaluated at harvest, after retrieval from cold storage and after 2 or 3 more days at 20\u00baC for ripening. Hydrocooled peaches dehydrated more, but both, hydrocooled and control peaches showed symptoms of shriveling after ripening at 20\u00baC. Decay losses of both cultivars did not differ amongst treatments during storage, though, were higher in 'Chimarrita' control peaches after ripening at 20&deg;C. Flesh firmness was similar in hydrocooled and not hydrocooled 'Chimarrita' peaches, but was higher in hydro cooled 'Chirip\u00e1' peaches during storage. In both cultivars flesh firmness decreased to the same values after ripening at 20\u00baC. After 21 days of cold storage, woolliness was observed in 50% of 'Chirip\u00e1' and in 15% of 'Chimarrita' hydro cooled and not hydrocooled peaches. Firmness retention was observed in 20% of 'Chirip\u00e1' and in 50% of 'Chimarrita' peaches.",

The model explains the concentration distribution, formed jointly by the settling of suspended particles and turbulent diffusion. The flow is assumed geostrophic above the bottom-influenced layer, while in the bottom layer the effect of turbulent diffusion by the large-scale turbulence constituent is assumed to dominate over the diffusion effect caused by the small-scale turbulence constituent. It is shown that for the characteristic diffusion length scale of the eddies much smaller than the height of the Ekman bottom boundary layer the model results in an analytic expression for the vertical distribution of the concentration of suspended sediment, which includes also the case with the presence of the lutocline. The model outcome is compared with the results of a laboratory experiment with sand-injected flume flow.",

He builds on the contributions of Gothard Gunther, who developed a Loqical system of multiple values, Lars Lofgren, who proposed the notion of 'autology', and Francisco Varela, who expanded the calculus of indications of G.

Von Foerster broadens the notion of autology and presents a general interpretation of the concept of computations based on trivial and non-trivial machines, in order to broadly develop the calculus of recursives.

            "abstract": "The aims of the present study were to assess the reaction of melon accessions to crater rot, caused by Myrothecium roridum, and study the inheritance of resistance. In the first experiment, 30 melon accessions from northeastern Brazil were assessed in a randomized block design with two replicates. Each plot was formed by a row of 12 plants, from which three fruits were sampled and used for inoculation. Each fruit was inoculated at four equidistant sites on the surface. Ten wounds were made at each site to an approximate depth of 3.0 mm, to which 0.05 mL of conidial suspension was placed at a concentration of 10(6) spores mL-1 of sterilized distilled water with the aid of a pipette. The fruits were placed on Petri dishes and enveloped in polyethylene bags containing hydrophilic cotton, both of which were moistened with sterilized distilled water. Five days after inoculation, the injured area (in mm\u00b2) was assessed. Accessions A-9, A-14 and A-30 were resistant to the CMM-609 isolate of M. roridum. In the second experiment, the parents AF-682 and UFERSA-05 were used as standards of susceptibility and resistance, respectively. From these plants, generations F1, F2, RC11 and RC12 were obtained. The six populations were grown under field conditions in a randomized block design. Resistance to crater rot on the melon fruits exhibited complex inheritance, with six loci and the involvement of additive and dominance effects.<br>Os objetivos do presente trabalho foram avaliar a rea\u00e7\u00e3o de germoplasma de meloeiro \u00e0 podrid\u00e3o-de-cratera, causada por Myrothecium roridum, e estudar a heran\u00e7a da resist\u00eancia. No primeiro experimento, foram avaliados 30 acessos de meloeiro coletados no Nordeste brasileiro. O delineamento experimental utilizado foi em blocos ao acaso com duas repeti\u00e7\u00f5es. Cada parcela foi formada por uma linha com 12 plantas, da qual tr\u00eas frutos foram amostrados e utilizados para inocula\u00e7\u00e3o. Cada fruto foi inoculado em quatro regi\u00f5es equidistantes na superf\u00edcie. Em cada regi\u00e3o foram realizados 10 ferimentos de aproximadamente 3,0 mm de profundidade. Nestes foram depositados 0,05 mL da suspens\u00e3o de con\u00eddios na concentra\u00e7\u00e3o de 10(6) esporos mL-1 de \u00e1gua destilada esterilizada por meio de uma pipeta. Os frutos foram colocados sobre placas de Petri e envoltos em sacos de polietileno, contendo algod\u00e3o hidr\u00f3filo, ambos umedecidos com \u00e1gua destilada esterilizada. A avalia\u00e7\u00e3o foi efetuada cinco dias ap\u00f3s a inocula\u00e7\u00e3o determinando-se a \u00e1rea lesionada (em mm\u00b2). Os acessos A-9, A-14 e A-30 foram resistentes ao isolado CMM-609 de Myroyhecium roridum. No segundo experimento, foram utilizados os genitores AF-682 e UFERSA-05, como padr\u00f5es de suscetibilidade e resist\u00eancia, respectivamente. A partir dos mesmos foram obtidas as gera\u00e7\u00f5es F1, F2, RC11 e RC12. As seis popula\u00e7\u00f5es foram cultivadas em condi\u00e7\u00f5es de campo em blocos ao acaso.

            "abstract": "The LA-MC-ICP-MS method applied to U-Pb in situ dating is still rapidly evolving due to improvements in both lasers and ICP-MS. To test the validity and reproducibility of the method, 5 different zircon samples, including the standard Temora-2, ranging in age between 2.2 Ga and 246 Ma, were dated using both LA-MC-ICP-MS and SHRIMP. The selected zircons were dated by SHRIMP and, after gentle polishing, the laser spot was driven to the same site or on the same zircon phase with a 213 nm laser microprobe coupled to a multi-collector mixed system. The data were collected with a routine spot size of 25 &#956;m and, in some cases, of 15 and 40 &#956;m. A careful cross-calibration using a diluted U-Th-Pb solution to calculate the Faraday reading to counting rate conversion factors and the highly suitable GJ-1 standard zircon for external calibrations were of paramount importance for obtaining reliable results. All age results were concordant within the experimental errors. The assigned age errors using the LA-MC-ICP-MS technique were, in most cases, higher than those obtained by SHRIMP, but if we are not faced with a high resolution stratigraphy, the laser technique has certain advantages.<br>O m\u00e9todo LA-MC-ICP-MS utilizado para data\u00e7\u00e3o U-Pb in situ est\u00e1 cada vez mais preciso e reprodut\u00edvel devido \u00e0 melhor desempenho t\u00e9cnico das microssondas a LASER e os espectr\u00f4metro de massa com plasma acoplado indutivamente (ICP-MS). Com intuito de testar a validade e a reprodutibilidade deste m\u00e9todo, 5 amostras diferentes foram selecionadas (incluindo o padr\u00e3o Temora 2), com idades entre 2.2 Ga e 246 Ma, para serem analisadas por ambos os m\u00e9todos LA-MC-ICPMS e SHRIMP. Os zirc\u00f5es selecionados foram primeiramente datados com SHRIMP e ap\u00f3s foram polidos para que fossem realizadas, na maior parte dos casos, as data\u00e7\u00f5es com microssonda a LASER de 213 nm acoplada a um espectr\u00f4metro de massa com multicoletor misto (copo Faraday e MIC\u00b4s), no mesmo local ou fase do gr\u00e3o. Os dados foram obtidos pela a\u00e7\u00e3o do laser com tamanho de feixe igual a 25 &#956;m, e mais raramente de 15 e 40 &#956;m. A calibra\u00e7\u00e3o cuidadosa entre o copo Faraday e MIC\u00b4s foi realizada com solu\u00e7\u00e3o dilu\u00edda de U-Th-Pb para calcular a taxa de convers\u00e3o entre os coletores e o uso de um padr\u00e3o de comportamento homog\u00eaneo e constante durante as an\u00e1lises, o padr\u00e3o GJ-1, para a calibra\u00e7\u00e3o externa foram decisivas para a obten\u00e7\u00e3o de resultados confi\u00e1veis.

In this perspective, this paper aims to analyze\r\nthe presence of the interlocutor\/other in personal letters of students from\r\nthe eighth grade \/ elementary school of a private school of the municipality\r\nof Marialva \u2013 Paran\u00e1. The presence of traces of a real interlocutor and an\r\nexternal real interlocutor will be analyzed, since the proposal requested a\r\nreceiver. Even so, a virtual and an internal interlocutor are observed. To\r\nsupport this analysis, readings and concepts developed by the Circle of\r\nBakhtin and by Brazilian researches that approach this theory were used.\r\nWhat is evident was the constant traces of a real external interlocutor, but,\r\nalso, some writing evidences for a real interlocutor, in addition to the\r\ninsignificant traces of a virtual interlocutor and no trace of an internal\r\ninterlocutor. The results of the analysis show that the students do not show\r\nmaturity in the use of the elements of a text, including, the interlocutor.",

            "abstract": "Construction law is a vital component of the body of knowledge that is needed by construction professionals in order to successfully operate in the commercial world of construction. Construction law plays an important role in shaping building projects. Construction projects are complex because they involve many human and non-human factors and variables. Teaching construction law is therefore a complex issue with several dimensions. In recent years, Information Technology (IT) has become strongly established as a supporting tool for many professions, including teachers. If faculty members have a knowledge base established on similar past projects, it would assist the faculty members to present case studies and contractually based scenarios to students. This paper proposes potential utilisation of a Knowledge-based System (KBS) for teaching construction law to built environment students. The KBS is primarily designed for building professionals to learn from similar past projects. The KBS is able to assist professionals by providing accurate and timelyinformation for decision making and a user-friendly tool for analysing and selecting the suggested controls for variations in educational buildings. It is recommended that the wealth of knowledge available in the KBS can be very helpful in teaching construction law to built environment students. The system presents real case studies and scenarios to students to allow them to analyse and learn construction law. The KBS could be useful to students as a general research tool because the students could populate it with their own data and use it with the reported educational projects. With further generic modifications, the KBS will also be useful for built environment students to learn about project management of building projects; thus, it will raise the overall level of professional understanding, and eventually productivity, in the construction industry.",

Al consolidarse la fruticultura entre 1940 y 1950, migrantes de origen chileno y del interior de las provincias de Neuqu\u00e9n y R\u00edo Negro llegaron a la zona para emplearse en las chacras. Algunos de ellos, junto a sus familias, optaron por conformar peque\u00f1os n\u00facleos de poblaci\u00f3n pr\u00f3ximos a las explotaciones agr\u00edcolas, constituyendo territorios con caracter\u00edsticas particulares. En este trabajo presentaremos algunas aproximaciones a la construcci\u00f3n social de territorios de trabajadores y a la movilidad espacial de esta fuerza de trabajo, relacionadas con las transformaciones en la producci\u00f3n de peras y manzanas en el Alto Valle de R\u00edo Negro.<br>The traditional space of the Alto Valle of Rio Negro in the north Argentinean Patagonia, was orientated from his beginnings to activities linked to the exportation of fresh fruit, likewise, it has been a point of confluence of traffic not only of capital and goods but also of labor. On the fruit-growing having consolidated between1940 and 1950, migrants from Chilean origin and from the provinces of Neuqu\u00e9n and Rio Negro came to the zone to work in the farms. Some of these new comers settled in small population near the agricultural areas, constituting territories with particular characteristics. In this work we will present some approximations to the social construction of workers' territories and to the spatial mobility of this workforce, related to the transformations in the production of pears and apples in the Alto Valle of Rio Negro.",

This technique is based on electrostatic interaction between citratecapped AuNP to amine terminal groups after surface modification of BDD and GC. The fabricated materials, AuNPBDD and AuNP-GC, were then utilized as electrodes for As3+ detection using anodic stripping voltammetry (ASV) technique. Anodic stripping voltammograms of both AuNP-BDD and AuNP-GC electrodes showed similar peak potentials of As\u00b0 oxidation at ~0.21 V (vs. Ag\/AgCl) in optimum conditions of -500 mV, 180 s, and 100 mV\/s for deposition potential, deposition time, and scan rate, respectively. AuNP-BDD shows better performances in the case of wide linear concentration range (0-20 mM) and low limit of detection (0.39 \u03bcM or 4.64 ppb), whereas those of AuNPGC were linear in the concentration range of 0-10mM with a detection limit of 0.14 \u03bcM (13.12 ppb). Excellent reproducibility was shown with RSDs (n=20) of 2.93% and 4.54% at AuNP-BDD and AuNP-GC, respectively. However, decreasing of current responses in 6-concecutive days was found more at AuNP-BDD (~20.1%) than that at AuNP-GC (~2.8%).",

This paper aims at discussing the meaning of the fantastic and tries to answer thequestion, is the fantastic an aesthetic concept, oris it \"a literary genre\". Our conclusion is thatfantastic exceeds the bounds of the frontier, it isbeyond the genre. The fantastic tends to translateaspiritual necessity, being our compensation desires, the dissatisfaction and the conflict of anycategory. The fantastic represents a way out from the daily automatism and the \"terror of history.\"The fantastic reaches the major anthropological andaesthetic fulfillment \u2013 including the world in itsindistinct global unity, by means of metaphorical speech, of the symbol and the mythical values. Evenif the Romanian literature has criticized the ideaof not having fantastic vocation, however, writerssuch as M. Eminescu, I.L. Caragiale, Mircea Eliadeor V. Voiculescu, because of their short prosefiction value, the fantasy literature confirms thefantastic route of the Romanian literature. VasileVoiculescu, the writer who was known as a talentedpoet, changed his literary development, making aremarkable storyteller who uses fantastic diegeticformula. Vasile Voiculescu's fantastic texts proposethe contemplation of the existential meditation andimportant themes of the man's aspiration for theabsolute still trying to reveal the unsearchable mysteries of the infinity.

            "abstract": "Introducci\u00f3n: la asociaci\u00f3n entre las mutaciones del gen CARD15 y la susceptibilidad gen\u00e9tica para la enfermedad de Crohn (EC) se ha confirmado en diversos estudios, con amplias variaciones observadas a nivel mundial, tanto geogr\u00e1ficas como \u00e9tnicas. Objetivos: analizar la prevalencia de gen CARD 15 y sus polimorfismos en pacientes con EC en Asturias y su posible correlaci\u00f3n con los diversos fenotipos de la enfermedad. M\u00e9todos: estudiamos la frecuencia de las tres mutaciones del gen CARD15 (R702W, G908R, L1007fs) usando cebadores espec\u00edficos, en un total de 216 pacientes con EC y 86 controles procedentes del \u00e1rea de Oviedo. Los pacientes fueron clasificados de acuerdo con la edad al diagn\u00f3stico, localizaci\u00f3n la enfermedad y su comportamiento cl\u00ednico (clasificaci\u00f3n de Viena). Resultados: la frecuencia global de portadores de las mutaciones del gen CARD15 en los pacientes con EC fue del 17,3% frente a un 17,6% en controles (NS). Al analizar separadamente los polimorfismos R702, G908R y L1007fs los pacientes mostraban frecuencias del 8,8, 3 y 6% respectivamente, mientras que los controles las presentaban en el 11,6, 2,3 y 3,5%, sin encontrar diferencias significativas para ninguna de ellas (NS). Las frecuencias observadas en controles, fueron similares a las encontradas en otras regiones espa\u00f1olas. Conclusiones: la prevalencia de mutaciones en CARD15 en pacientes con EC en Asturias es menor a la reportada en otros trabajos publicados en poblaci\u00f3n espa\u00f1ola. Otros factores ambientales, adem\u00e1s de los gen\u00e9ticos, parecen tener mayor importancia en el desarrollo de EC en nuestra \u00e1rea.<br>Background: the association between the three common CARD15 gene mutations (R702W, G908R, L1007fs) and the genetic susceptibility to Crohn's disease (CD) have been confirmed by several studies, with some differences found, in relation to geographic areas and ethnic groups. Objectives: To analyze the prevalence of CARD15 gen and its polymorphisms in patients with CD in Asturias and its possible correlation with the different genotypes of the disease. Methods: a total of 216 CD patients recruited from Asturias (North of Spain) and 86 ethnically matched healthy controls, were typed using Hybprobes on a LightCycler instrument for CARD15 mutations. Patients were subdivided according to Vienna classification. We have studied the frequency of these mutations in the different subgroups of CD patients and analyzed its contribution to the disease clinical characteristics and progression. Results: carrier frequencies for CARD15 mutations in our CD patients were similar to controls (17.8 vs. 17.4%) respectively (NS). CD patients exhibited frequencies of 8.8, 3.0 and 6.0% for the R702, G908R and L1007fs polymorphisms respectively, whereas our control population had allele frequencies of 11.6, 2.3 and 3.5% for the three mutations respectively (NS). We did not find any relationship between CARD15 mutations and the different phenotypes of Crohn's disease, according to Vienna classification. Conclusions: in our CD population, other factors (i.e. environmental), in addition to genetics, must be mainly involved in the development of the disease.",

We enrolled 16 chro-nic HD patients with moderate to severe heart failure and left ventricle ejection fraction :5 45&#x0025;. In a double blinded randomized placebo controlled study, one group of 8 patients received 25 mg of spi-ronolactone after each dialysis session within six months, and the rest received a placebo. Echo-cardiography was performed on all the patients to assess ejection fraction and left ventricular mass during 12 hours after completion of hemodialysis at the beginning and the end of study. Serum potassium was measured predialysis every 4 weeks. The mean ejection fraction increased signi-ficantly more in spironolactone group during the study period than in the placebo group (6.2 &#x00B1; 1.64 vs. 0.83 &#x00B1; 4.9, P= 0.046). The mean left ventricular mass decreased in the spironolactone group, but increased significantly in the placebo group during the period (-8.4 &#x00B1; 4.72 vs. 3 &#x00B1; 7.97. 95&#x0025;, P= 0.021). The incidence of hyperkalemia was not significantly increased in the study or controlled groups. In conclusion, we found in this study that administration of spironolactone in chronic HD patients with moderate to severe heart failure substantially improved their cardiac function and decreases left ventricular mass without development of significant hyperkalemia.",

The objective of this study was to evaluate some relations between the mite B. phoenicis over horseweed plants (Conyza canadensis) for different heights. To determine the oviposition and survival of B. phoenicis, an experiment arranged in a complete randomized statistical design was carried out, with five treatments and twelve replications. The treatments established were: (1) plants smaller than 20 cm, (2) plants with height between 21 to 50 cm, (3) plants with height between 51 to 100 cm and (4) plants taller than 101 cm, as well as (5) branch sections of the orange plant. Ten female adults of B. phoenicis were transferred to each section. Survival and oviposition were evaluated 120 hours after transference. The mite was also photomicrographed using a scanning electron microscope. Taller horseweed plants were biased toward B. phoenicis' survival, compared to lower plants. However, the number of laid eggs was not different according to horseweed height. Based on the photomicrography, it was possible to verify B. phoenicis 'preference for feeding on the trichome base located on the stem surface of the horseweed. This is possibly justified based on the increased cell turgor in this part. Therefore, the large number of trichomes present in horseweed plants can promote higher survival range and development of B. phoenicis , being thus used as an alternative host, what may contribute to the spread of this mite population and, consequently, of leprosis over the citrus orchards.",

The project presented here looked into the modeling of fish physiology for applications in fish physiology research and aquaculture. The models deal with gastric evacuation, metabolism, kidneys, gills, the cardiovascular system, and feeding behaviour and are based on data from the literature. Model responses are mostly in accord with real responses in principle, but, as with most models of complex biological systems, the numerical accuracy is low in several cases. However, these structured models enable researchers to test hypotheses by altering the submodels and parameters. ",

Histologically, BFH of soft tissues and bone shows similar features, but BFH of the bone is rare with less than 100 cases reported worldwide and usually it involves tibia, femur, and pelvic bone. As far as the oral cavity is concerned, majority of the BFHs are found in the soft tissues of the buccal mucosa, gingiva, lower and upper lips, soft palate, and floor of the mouth. Occurrence of this tumor in the jaw bones is extremely rare as only one case of the maxilla and six cases of the mandible have been reported so far . Hence, the purpose of this article is to report the second case of BFH of the maxilla in a 23-year-old female patient and to review the literature of this entity affecting the jaws.",

            "abstract": "Background & objectives: Dengue is an arboviral disease of public health importance in many parts of India and recently many cases have been reported from northeastern India. Aedes mosquitoes, which are the vectors of dengue, are widely prevalent in the region. A study was initiated in Sonitpur district of Assam to understand the spatiotemporal distribution and seasonal prevalence of dengue vectors and to identify the high risk zones. \n Methods: Ovitrap surveys were conducted in three randomly selected villages under each of the eight public health centres (PHC) in district Sonitpur of Assam, northeastern India during March 2011 - February 2012. Three risk zones (high, medium and low) were identified on the basis of per trap density of Aedes mosquitoes. Meteorological data were collected to study the temporal distribution of dengue vectors. \n Results: Aedes albopictus (99.3%) was the predominant dengue vector followed by Ae. aegypti (0.7%) recorded in the ovitraps. The highest vector density was observed during the post-monsoon (60.1 \u00b1 18 per trap) while the lowest during the winter (7.6 \u00b1 4.9 per trap) and the season-wise differences in the vector density were significant ( p0 =0.005). Maximum temperature (correlation coefficient, r = 0.45) and minimum temperature (r = 0.408) showed the highest positive correlation with the vector density, whereas the number of rainy days showed high positive correlation (r = 0.185) than the total rainfall (r = 0.117). The high risk zone (Dekhiajuli, Behali, Bihaguri and Gohpur PHC) as indicated by the high larval densities of dengue vectors, 45.3 \u00b1 18, 42.1 \u00b1 22.3, 36.9 \u00b1 29.1, 35.3 \u00b1 22.6 per trap, respectively, was validated by dengue epidemiological data collected during 2012. \nInterpretation & conclusions: Yearlong monitoring of dengue vectors was done for the first time in this region. Monthly maximum temperature and the number of rainy days could be used for the prediction of larval density of Aedes mosquitoes. The identification high dengue risk zones would help in adopting targeted interventions for disease management in future.",

In this regard, we undertook a piece of quantitative marketing research using, especially, a series of descriptive and inferential statistics elements so as to meet our research objectives: highlighting the financing forms used by the economic entities in the two counties, identifying the proportion in which lease is used and describing the main constraints existing when financing companies by leasing. The research results underline the fact that the main business entities use this financing system, it being considered more advantageous than the bank loan. Moreover, we notice some differences between the two counties analysed suggesting the existence of an important influence of the local business environment. ",

            "abstract": "In this paper, we describe how the Harthill Leadership Development Profile(LDP), a language-based instrument has evolved from Jane Loevinger\u2019s WashingtonUniversity Sentence Completion Test (WUSCT), and has been redesigned to assess andoffer feedback about adults\u2019 action logics in work or educational settings, in the contextof Developmental Action Inquiry (DAI) theory, practice, and method (Torbert, 1972,1976, 1987, 1991; Torbert & Associates, 2004).Next, we challenge a recent critique of the LDP as a soft measure unsupported bypublished, quantitative psychometric reliability and validity studies (Stein & Heikkinen,2009) and present both previously unpublished and previously published-but-notaggregatedstudies illustrating Harthill LDP as a well-calibrated measure of adult egodevelopment.Because the DAI approach to social inquiry and social practice invites us all tointerweave first-, second-, and third-person inquiry and everyday action, the validitystudies reported tend to concern field-based experiments seeking to generatedevelopmentally transforming change in adults, including the researchers and\/orinterventionists, as well as in the organizations in which they participate.In our conclusion, we briefly consider what a social science and a social practice basedon the developmentally late action-logics will look like, once social science is recognizedas embracing, not just 3rd-person empirical positivist research \u201con\u201d subjects, but also 1st-,2nd-, and 3rd-person research and action with co-participants in live settings.",

            "abstract": "We calculated the photoinduced decomposition of various nitrotoluene molecules, resulting in the formation of atomic carbon, at the B3LYP\/6-311++G(d,p) level of theory using Gaussian 09. In addition, we used TD-DFT (B3LYP\/6-311++G(d,p)) to calculate the excitation energies. The results confirm our previously reported experimental results. Specifically, we show that the absorption of 226 nm (5.49 eV) light can lead to the decomposition of nitrotoluene molecules and the formation of atomic carbon. One 226 nm photon is sufficient for the dissociation of carbon from 2-NT and 4-NT molecules. During the dissociation process, the CH3 group provides the dissociated carbon atom and the NO2 group accepts the H atoms from either the CH3 group or the benzene ring before carbon exits the molecular system. For the second and third carbon dissociation of 2-NT, the energy barriers are 6.70 eV and 7.43 eV, respectively, and two 226 nm photons would need to be absorbed by the molecule. If extra NO is present during the first carbon dissociation of 2-NT, it gets involved in the last two decomposition steps and forms a C=NH-N=O structure which stabilizes the decomposition products and lowers the energy barrier from 5.22 eV to 4.70 eV. However, for the second and third carbon dissociation of 2-NT, the NO molecules have no apparent effect. For nitrotoluene molecules with two or three NO2 groups (i.e., 2,4-DNT, 2,6-DNT, 3,4-DNT, and 2,4,6-TNT), the first carbon dissociation energies are between 5.26 eV and 5.57 eV. The carbon dissociation pathways for these molecules are similar to those of 2-NT. In 2,4-DNT, the lowest energy barriers for the second and third carbon dissociation are 6.54 eV and 6.60 eV, respectively, which are about 1 eV higher than the energy barrier for the first carbon dissociation. In case of 2,4-DNT\/NO and 2,4,6-TNT\/NO, NO acts as a catalyst in the first carbon dissociation processes and forms a C=NH-N=O structure which lowers the energy barriers by 0.48 eV and 0.89 eV, respectively.",

A novel ring resonator with eight S-shaped symmetrical supporting springs is developed based on the advantageous characteristics of a thin-shell vibrating gyroscope. The capacitance electrodes, including the drive electrodes, the sense electrodes and the mode control electrodes, are designed according to the vibration characteristics of the ring resonator and the shape of the supporting springs. In addition, the operational principle of these electrode capacitors and the electrostatic force of the drive electrodes are discussed in detail. The gyroscope with high aspect-ratio structures is manufactured through an efficient fabrication process. Finally, the performance characteristics of the fabricated VRG are tested, and the experimentally obtained the zero-bias instability is about 0.0167\u00b0\/s and angle random walk (ARW) is about 0.1363\u00b0\/s1\/2 at room temperature. Experimental results show that the VRG has a simple structure and relatively better performance characteristics for low and medium angular velocity measurements.",

The pitch of pre-patterned holes (NW sites) changed to an In\/Ga alloy-composition in the solid phase during the NW growth. The In composition with a nanometer-scaled pitch differed completely from that with a \u03bcm-scaled pitch. Accordingly, the growth morphologies of InGaAs NWs show different behavior with respect to the In\/Ga ratio.",

The obvious variation of DC voltages for Py\/Nd:STO, obtained by inverting the spin diffusion direction, demonstrated that the detected signals contained the contribution from the inverse spin Hall effect (ISHE) induced by the spin dependent scattering from Nd impurities with strong spin-orbit interaction. The DC voltages of the ISHE for Nd:STO were measured at different microwave frequency and power, which revealed that spin currents were successfully injected into doped STO layer by spin pumping. The linear relation between the ISHE resistivity and the resistivity induced by impurities implied that the skew scattering was the dominant contribution in this case, and the spin Hall angle was estimated to be (0.17\u00b10.05)%. This work demonstrated that extrinsic spin dependent scattering in oxides can be used in spintronics besides that in heavy elements doped metals.",

All the specimens prepared by a conventional solid sintering technique exhibit the excellent sintering ability with a high relative density over 97%. It is found that, as BMT added, the specimens undergo a structure crossover from ferroelectric P4mm to ergodic P4bm, and the coexistence of both tetragonal structures takes bridge between them. A large field-induced strain of 0.30% and field-independent strain coefficient of 0.0254 m4\/C2 occur at 4 mol.% BMT added. This material with excellent sinterability is suitable for the application in actuators and microposition controllers.",

Issues with quaternary semiconductors include chemical disorder (e.g., Cu\u2013Zn antisites) and disproportionation into secondary phases (e.g., ZnS and Cu2SnS3). To provide a reference for the pure kesterite structure, we report the vibrational spectra\u2014including both infra-red and Raman intensities\u2014from lattice-dynamics calculations using first-principles force constants. Three-phonon interactions are used to estimate phonon lifetimes (spectral linewidths) and thermal conductivity. CZTS exhibits a remarkably low lattice thermal conductivity, competitive with high-performance thermoelectric materials. Transition from the sulfide to selenide (Cu2ZnSnSe4) results in softening of the phonon modes and an increase in phonon lifetimes.",

The control of this enhancement is achieved by a gradual variation of the dispersion in the system by means of a chirp of the lattice constant. The sound enhancement is produced at some planes of the crystal in which the wave is softly reflected due to a progressive slowing down of the sound wave. We find that the character of the sound enhancement depends on the function of the variation of dispersion, i.e., on the function of the chirp. A simple coupled mode theory is proposed to find the analytical solutions of the sound wave enhancement in the exponentially chirped crystal. Harmonic and time domain numerical simulations are performed to interpret the concept of the soft reflections, and to check the analytically calculated field distributions both in good agreement with experiments. Specially we obtain stronger sound enhancement than in linearly chirped crystals. This sound enhancement could motivate applications in energy harvesting, e.g., to increase the efficiency of detectors and absorbers.\n         ",

It involves four kindergartners from different schools. The data were collected through observations and interviews and then analysed by constant comparisons. The findings revealed there were four commonalities of the learning activities, namely, (1) answering questions in English; (2) listening to a model speaking English; (3) imitating, and (4) repeating the English utterances. Among the four, answering questions was the most frequent way. Meanwhile, the language production varied covering single word utterances, verb phrases, simple sentences (S+V+O) or (S+V+O+Adv.)in simple present tense, and exclamation. The proposition generated from the present study is that kindergartners will learn to speak English if they are often asked questions in English which they understand and are engaged in an interaction in English where they need to listen, imitate, and repeat ",

The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of core-shell nanowires indicate that Mg addition has little influence on the morphology of the synthesizing products. High crystalline quality ZnO\/MgO core-shell nanowires instead of ZnMgO ternary compounds are identified by X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images, selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern and photoluminescence (PL) spectra. The experimental results show that the ultraviolet (UV) emission of these samples with MgO shell is 12 times higher than that of the corresponding bare ZnO nanowires, and the suppression of the green emission is only 1\/45 of the bare ZnO nanowires. It is also found that PL properties are proportional to Mg ratio. The UV emission enhancement and green emission suppression are due to the passivation of surface defects and the improvement of ZnO crystalline quality. The results are very useful for the development of optical devices based on nanowires.\n         ",

Here, I report reliable synthetic methods of the reticular type porous structure toward simple compositional variations. Due to the reproducibility of reticular type porous titania films from titanium alkoxide (e.g., TTIP; titanium tetraisopropoxide), a titania-silica film having similar porous structure was obtained by mixing silicon alkoxide (e.g., tetraethoxysilane) and TTIP followed by their pre-hydrolysis, and the mixing ratio of Ti to Si composition was easily reached to 1.0. For further compositional design, a concept of surface coating was widely applicable; the reticular type porous titania surfaces can be coated with other oxides such as silica. Here, a silica coating was successfully achieved by the simple chemical vapor deposition of silicon alkoxide (e.g., tetramethoxysilane) without water (with water at the humidity level), which was also utilized for pore filling with silica by the similar process with water.",

Electronic properties of the channel materials are evaluated using the local density approximation (LDA) in density functional theory (DFT). For phonon dispersion we employ the small displacement \/ frozen phonon calculations in DFT. Thereafter using the non-equilibrium Green\u2019s function (NEGF) formalism, we study the effect of electron-phonon scattering and the contribution of various phonon modes on the performance of such devices. It is found that the performance of the WSe2 device is less impacted by phonon scattering, showing a ballisticity of 83% for 1L-WSe2 FET for channel length of 10 nm. Though 1L-MoS2 FET of similar dimension shows a lesser ballisticity of 75%. Also in the presence of scattering there exist a a 21\u201336% increase in the intrinsic delay time (\u03c4) and a 10\u201318% reduction in peak transconductance (gm) for WSe2 and MoS2 devices respectively.\n         ",

            "abstract": "Purpose The aim of this study was to evaluate whether the comet tail artifact on ultrasonography can be used to reliably diagnose benign gallbladder diseases. Methods This retrospective study reviewed the clinical findings, imaging findings, preoperative ultrasonographic diagnoses, and pathological diagnoses of 150 patients with comet tail artifacts who underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy with pathologic confirmation. The extent of the involved lesion was classified as localized or diffuse, depending on the degree of involvement and the anatomical section of the gallbladder that was involved. This study evaluated the differences in clinical and imaging findings among pathologic diagnoses. Results All gallbladder lesions exhibiting the comet tail artifact on ultrasound examination were confirmed as benign gallbladder diseases after cholecystectomy, including 71 cases of adenomyomatosis (47.3%), 74 cases of chronic cholecystitis (49.3%), two cases of xanthogranulomatous cholecystitis (1.3%), and three cases of cholesterolosis (2.0%); there were two cases of coexistent chronic cholecystitis and low-grade dysplasia. There were no statistically significant differences in any of the clinical and ultrasonographic findings, with the exception of gallstones (P=0.007), among the four diseases. There were no significant differences in the average length, thickness, or number of comet tail artifacts among the four diagnoses. No malignancies were detected in any of the 150 thickened gallbladder lesions. Conclusion The ultrasonographic finding of the comet tail artifact in patients with thickened gallbladder lesions is associated with the presence of benign gallbladder diseases, and can be considered a reliable sign of benign gallbladder disease.",

            "abstract": "Abstract Background Right ventricular lead placement is one of the fundamental procedures during pacemaker implantation through the subclavian vein. Currently, there are two techniques to deliver the lead to the right ventricle: the catheter and stylet delivery systems. Surgeons, especially trainees in the early stage of training, are known to face difficulty while delivering the lead to the right ventricle. The objective of this study is to investigate and compare the two techniques of lead delivery by trainees in patients who are scheduled to undergo pacemaker implantation. Methods This is a prospective, single\u2010center, randomized controlled clinical trial. One\u2010hundred patients who were scheduled to undergo pacemaker implantation with a right ventricular lead will be randomized such that the pacemaker can be implanted via either the catheter delivery system or the stylet delivery system at a 1:1 ratio. The primary endpoint is the total number of attempts needed to place the lead in the ideal position. Secondary endpoints are the efficacy and safety of the implantation procedure. All implantation procedures will be performed by trainees under the supervision of expert cardiologists. Results The results of this study are currently under investigation. Conclusion This will be the first clinical trial to compare the efficacy and safety of the catheter delivery system and the stylet delivery system during the implantation of the ventricular lead in pacemaker implantation. Our findings are expected to improve the lead implantation procedure by providing information about which delivery system to choose in which situation.",

Telegram also provides APIs for their users, enabling the development of a bot system that allows instant messaging application to access information. Here, we study the potential use of Telegram bot as a user interface to a paperless office (PLO) system developed in our institution. We found that Telegram bot improves communication among the users; however, as the amount of messages increased, the server becomes overloaded. This limitation suggests that future works need to be directed to improving the efficiency of the bot",

DBN is composed of a Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) stack. The DBN structure is optimally determined through experiments. The Adam method is applied to accelerate learning in DBN because it is able to achieve good results quickly compared to other stochastic optimization methods such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) by maintaining the level of learning for each parameter.\n\nTests are carried out on USD \/ IDR daily exchange rate data and four evaluation criteria are adopted to evaluate the performance of the proposed method. The DBN-Adam model produces RMSE 59.0635004, MAE 46.406739, MAPE 0.34652. DBN-Adam is also able to reach the point of convergence quickly, where this result is able to outperform the DBN-SGD model.",

            "abstract": "The modalities currently employed to screen for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM)\/prediabetes are HbA1c, fasting plasma glucose (FPG), and 2-hour plasma glucose (PG) during an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). The purpose of this review is to highlight the positive qualities and pitfalls of these diagnostic modalities and reflect on the most reasonable and effective approach to screen high risk youth. Given its inherent preanalytical advantages, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) continues to be the preferred diagnostic modality used by pediatricians to screen high risk youth. However, when the three aforementioned tests are performed in youths of different races\/ethnicities, discrepant results for T2DM\/prediabetes are observed. The prevalence rates for T2DM vary from 0.53% in Chinese youth (including youth of all body mass indexes) to 18.3% in high-risk, overweight, obese Korean youth. Moreover, the FPG is abnormal (>100 less than <126 mg\/dL) in 15% of Korean youth versus 8.7% of Chinese youth. The prevalence rates for prediabetes are 1.49% in Chinese youth versus 21% in Emirati youth (HbA1c, 5.7%\u20136.4%). The coefficient of agreement, k, between these screening tests for T2DM are fair, 0.45\u20130.5 across all youth. However, using HbA1c as a comparator, the agreement is weak with FPG (k=0.18 in German youth versus k=0.396 in Korean youth). The American Diabetes Association (ADA) Standards of Medical Care Guidelines define \u201chigh risk youth\u201d who need to be tested for T2DM and\/or prediabetes. OGTT and HbA1c do not always detect T2DM in similar individuals. HbA1c may not be an ideal test for screening Hispanic and African American youth. FPG and OGTT are suitable screening tests for youth of ethnic minorities and those with cystic fibrosis or hemoglobinopathies. Performing all three tests either together or sequentially may be the only way to encompass all youth who have aberrations in different aspects of glucose homeostasis.",

            "abstract": "Over the last decades, the onset of puberty in girls has occurred earlier, but the tempo of pubertal progression has been relatively slower, resulting in a younger age at puberty onset without a change in age at menarche. Sufficient energy availability and adiposity contribute to early pubertal development, and environmental factors, such as endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs), may affect not only the control of energy balance, but also puberty and reproduction. EDCs are hormonally active substances that can perturb puberty by acting both peripherally on target organs, such as adipose tissue or adrenal glands, and\/or centrally on the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis. Depending on whether the exposure takes place earlier during fetal and neonatal life or later during early childhood, EDCs can lead to different outcomes through different mechanisms. Evidence of associations between exposures to EDCs and altered pubertal timing makes it reasonable to support their relationship. However, human epidemiologic data are limited or inconsistent and cannot provide sufficient evidence for a causal relationship between EDC exposure and changes in pubertal timing. Further investigation is warranted to determine the overall or different effects of EDCs exposure during prenatal or childhood windows on pubertal milestones and to reveal the underlying mechanisms, including epigenetic marks, whereby early-life exposure to EDCs affect the HPG-peripheral tissue axis.",

            "abstract": "Most of Indonesian organizations either it is government or non government sometime required their member to provide their identity card (E-KTP) as legal document collection in their database. This collection of image usually being used as manual verification method. These document images acquired by each person with their own device, there are variations of angles they are used to acquire the image. This situation created problems in text recognition by OCR softwares especially in text detection part, orientation and noise will affect their accuracy. These cases making the text detection more complex and cannot be solved by simple vertical projection profile of black pixels. \u00a0This research proposed a method to improve text detection in identity document by fixing the orientation first, then using MSER regions to form text region. We fix the orientation using the line that made by Progressive Probabilistic Hough Transform. Then we used MSER to obtain all candidate regions and Horizontal RLSA acts as connector between those candidate. The orientation fixing strategy reach average of margin error 0.377o (in 360o system) and the text detection method reach 84.49% accuracy in best condition.",

The pathogenesis of this disease is based on paroxysmal discharges in the brain neurons. Epilepsy is characterized by a difference in the level of peripheral blood autoantibodies (aAT) to the level of the glutamate receptor GluR1, which is a subunit of AMPA receptors (GluR1) and an increased level of IgG and IgM immunoglobulins between the group of patients with epilepsy and the group of healthy ones. We analyzed the serum of 30 healthy donors and 70 patients with epilepsy. The method of IR-spectroscopy in combination with multivariate analysis is proposed as a diagnostic method. In the course of the work, the following types of multivariate analysis were used to assess the correct probability of diagnosis: the principal component method (PCA) and the projection onto latent structures (PLS) method. Each of the presented methods gives the best results when using the \ufb01rst derivative of the spectra in the whole spectrum range. When analyzing this sample by regression procedures, the sensitivity was 100 % and the speci\ufb01city of analysis was 76.9%.",

Adem\u00e1s, se estudi\u00f3 la asociaci\u00f3n de fluorosis con prote\u00edna C-reactiva (PCR) y talla. Se realiz\u00f3 un estudio transversal en 222 escolares del \u00e1rea rural y 285 del \u00e1rea urbana, de 7 a 13 a\u00f1os. Se relacion\u00f3 el grado de fluorosis con la concentraci\u00f3n de fl\u00faor en el agua y la orina, la sal de consumo y la concentraci\u00f3n de PCR en la sangre. La prevalencia de fluorosis dental fue mayor en el \u00e1rea rural que en la urbana: 80,7 versus 74%. Seg\u00fan el \u00cdndice de Fluorosis de Dean, la fluorosis moderada y severa tuvieron porcentajes m\u00e1s elevados en el \u00e1rea rural que en la urbana: de 4,2 a 23% versus 0,4 a 4,1%, respectivamente. La edad (OR: 1,23; IC: 1,01 a 1,51; p = 0,04) y el contenido del fl\u00faor en la sal (OR: 7,3; IC: 2,29 a 23,4; p = 0,001) se asociaron significativamente con la severidad de la fluorosis solo en los ni\u00f1os del \u00e1rea rural. La severidad de la fluorosis no se asoci\u00f3 con la concentraci\u00f3n de PCR ni con la talla de los ni\u00f1os. Este estudio sugiere que los ni\u00f1os de mayor edad de escuelas rurales tienen m\u00e1s riesgo de fluorosis, posiblemente por persistente y excesivo consumo de fl\u00faor en la sal.",

In conclusion, the research challenges are pinpointed, which the community should address as to be able to observe and model, at a regional-scale, the coupled climate-water cycle in response to the human induced changes in climate and land use. The findings presented herein are a compilation resulting from an extensive literature review and the personal expertise of the authors. Given the focus on hydrologic modeling, many other aspects such as the best practices of integrated water resources management, cross-boundary water governance, the establishment of institutional frameworks, empowerment of local communities to participate effectively in water management and policy making, among many other very relevant aspects, were intentionally not considered as not to dilute the focus of the paper.",

            "abstract": "The overall performance of a wastewater treatment plant is in addition to the effectiveness of the biokinetic processes controlled by the flow dynamics. A wide used technique to characterize the water flow dynamics is the use of tracers. At full-scale tracer experiments in wastewater treatment plants provide insufficient information to completely grasp the flow dynamics. Additionally results are often biased by uncontrolled external factors. As alternative, computational fluid dynamic (CFD) models for performance analysis of existing and the design of new wastewater treatment plants have been increasingly used over the last decade. The paper presents the results of a tracer experiment against the output of a CFD model with application to a 7 ha large maturation pond. The tracer study was conducted with the fluorescence dye Rhodamine WT using the stimulus response technique. The three dimensional CFD model was built considering a variable density distribution of spatial grids based on the specific characteristics of the system. For the unsteady flow simulations the turbulence model k-e was adopted. Residence time distribution (RTD) generated by both approaches were compared and showed fairly good agreement. The velocity and turbulence profiles of the CFD model were compared with experimental data confirming, although the high computational demand, the robustness of the used CFD model.",

            "abstract": "Characterization of climate variability in the Andes mountain range needs special assessment as rainfall and temperature are extremely variable in space and time. This paper examines the anomalies of observed month rainfall and temperature data of respectively 25 and 16 stations, from the early 1960\u201fs to the 1990\u201fs and compare them against anomalies from different external climate influences in annual and 3-month seasonal block periods. The stations are located in the R\u00edo Paute Basin in the Ecuador\u201fs southern Andes. All stations are within the elevation band 1800 and 4200 m a.s.l. and affected by the Tropical Pacific, Amazon and Tropical Atlantic climate. The results show similar temperature variations for the entire region, which are highly influenced by the ENSO, especially during the DJF season. During JJA, the correlation is weaker showing the influence of other climate factors. Higher temperature anomalies are found at the high elevation sites while in deep valleys the anomalies are less significant. Rainfall variations depend, in addition to elevation, on additional factors such as the aspect orientation, slope and hydrological regime. Highest and most significant rainfall anomalies are found in the eastern sites.",

            "abstract": "This manuscript discusses a study that was conducted among incoming international exchange students at the University of Cuenca, Ecuador in the period 2011-2013. Its focus was not on the students\u2019 educational experiences, but rather on their opinions about the tourism services that were provided and on their travel preferences. Several comparative analyses of the opinions of males vs. females and of Latin American students vs. European\/US students found significant differences of opinion regarding the various experiences. The manuscript makes a contribution to the literature in its focus on the students\u2019 perceptions about tourism services in Ecuador and on their travel behaviors. It offers practical recommendations for university administrators, tourism executives and policy makers as they try to enhance the country\u2019s tourism offerings and to improve Ecuador\u2019s image as a safe, well-developed tourism destination and as a welcoming site for international exchange students.",

Escasa investigaci\u00f3n se ha realizado sobre la influencia de la capacitaci\u00f3n a profesores de ingl\u00e9s. Este estudio tiene el prop\u00f3sito de determinar el impacto de la capacitaci\u00f3n en el empleo de estrategias comunicativas en el aula. Doce profesores fiscales de educaci\u00f3n media que fueron capacitados en estrategias comunicativas en un curso1 de 110 horas presenciales y 20 horas de trabajo extra, son los sujetos de esta investigaci\u00f3n. Se emple\u00f3 una investigaci\u00f3n cuasi-experimental de car\u00e1cter prospectivo longitudinal, pues se utiliz\u00f3 una pre-observaci\u00f3n, realizada antes de la intervenci\u00f3n; una pos-observaci\u00f3n, llevada a cabo luego de la finalizaci\u00f3n de la capacitaci\u00f3n y una re-observaci\u00f3n despu\u00e9s de dos a\u00f1os de esta culminaci\u00f3n.

There is also a common agreement that the quality of early mathematical instruction has an important influence on children\u00b4s subsequent learning. In Ecuador studies on young children\u00b4s early mathematical competencies and instruction are scare. Therefore a study was initiated to (1) assess the numerical competencies of preschoolers and kindergartners (first year of elementary education) attending a public school in Cuenca, with the objective to critically analyze their numerical thinking and reasoning, and (2) examine teachers\u2019 practices and believes regarding early mathematical instruction and children\u00b4s mathematical competencies. An application of the Number Knowledge Test (Griffin, 2005) demonstrated that most of the participating children had not developed basic numerical competencies. In addition, teachers strongly believe that young children are incapable of carrying out mathematical thoughts. As a consequence, mathematical activities in which children and teachers are engaged are insufficiently developed. The scientific and practical implications of these results are discussed.",

            "abstract": "Un deslizamiento de tierra puede ser considerado como un ensayo de campo a gran escala, donde el an\u00e1lisis a posteriori o modelaci\u00f3n inversa proporciona directamente los par\u00e1metros geomec\u00e1nicos del suelo. Por otra parte, se evita la necesidad de obtener una muestra representativa en campo para realizar los ensayos de laboratorio. En el presente manuscrito se propone un procedimiento num\u00e9rico para el an\u00e1lisis a posteriori de deslizamientos, que combina el m\u00e9todo de los elementos finitos con t\u00e9cnicas de optimizaci\u00f3n. Se emplearon los algoritmos de optimizaci\u00f3n no lineal de m\u00ednimos cuadrados denominado (NLLS) y el de minimizadores locales combinados (CLM). Un ejemplo ilustrativo es desarrollado considerando un talud simple y homog\u00e9neo. Los resultados obtenidos demuestran que el algoritmo implementado es eficiente y robusto, capaz de determinar adecuadamente las propiedades geomec\u00e1nicas del suelo a posteriori de un deslizamiento. Este m\u00e9todo supera muchas de las limitaciones e incertidumbres presentes en la determinaci\u00f3n de los par\u00e1metros geomec\u00e1nicos obtenidos a trav\u00e9s de ensayos en el laboratorio o de pruebas in situ. Par\u00e1metros geomec\u00e1nicos calculados mediante el presente algoritmo puede ser utilizados confiablemente para el an\u00e1lisis de la estabilidad de laderas con similares caracter\u00edsticas o laderas que est\u00e9n ubicadas en la misma zona de estudio.",

            "abstract": "Allowing cyclists in bus lanes is an alternative to encourage diversity in mobility within consolidated cities, as this allows providing an infrastructure for cycling in places where for the limited right-of-way it is not possible to provide an independent lane. Apart of efficiency and safety, combining two modes of transport in the same space generates concerns such as the bus-cyclist interaction. Therefore, the design of shared bus-bike lanes (SBBLs) should ensure efficiency and safety for buses and cyclists. The lack of a general standard for the design of SBBLs hindered their implementation in the cities of developing countries that generally lack the human, economic and technical resources to adjust via research the design to the prevailing local conditions. This paper presents an analysis of design guidelines for SBBLs applied in Europe, North America and Australia, showing that the type of cycling infrastructure, the alignment within the SBBL and the lane width, are the parameters that should be considered to ensure safety and efficiency of these two modes. Furthermore, review of the literature on bus and bicycle mobility systems in Paris, revealed that increasing the public transport and cycling ridership not only depends on the quality of the built infrastructure, but also on the coordination between the design, operation, enforcement and control of the proper use of such structures and the measures implemented to discourage the use of private vehicles.",

However, few studies have researched on the occupational burnout of CDC employees in the world. Previous studies have reported that transformational leadership could improve the level of psychological empowerment and ameliorate burnout of the employees. In this study, we aimed to analyze the association between transformational leadership and burnout and to test the mediating role of psychological empowerment in this relationship among CDC employees in China.Methods: Maslach Burnout Inventory-Human Service Survey, Transformational Leadership Questionnaire, and Psychological Empowerment Scale were used to measure burnout, transformational leadership, and psychological empowerment. A total of 385 CDC employees (effective response rate: 96.25%) were included in the study. We analyzed the association between transformational leadership and three subscales of burnout with hierarchical linear regression analyses. The mediating role of psychological empowerment was finally examined by asymptotic and resampling strategies.Results: Transformational leadership was negatively associated with emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and reduced personal accomplishment after controlling sociodemographic and working context characteristics. Transformational leadership and psychological empowerment, respectively, accounted for 9.3% and 12.3% of the variance in emotional exhaustion; 8.5% and 16.7% of the variance in depersonalization; and 6.7% and 10.0% of the variance in reduced personal accomplishment. We found that psychological empowerment played a partially mediating role on the relationship between transformational leadership and burnout. The proportion of psychological empowerment&rsquo;s mediating effect was 41.56% for emotional exhaustion, 50.62% for depersonalization, and 44.32% for reduced personal accomplishment.Conclusions: It was suggested that transformational leadership could decrease the risk of burnout by the pathway of promoting the employee&rsquo;s psychological empowerment. Interventions focusing on transformational leadership and psychological empowerment should be of significance to cut burnout.Keywords: burnout, transformational leadership, psychological empowerment, CDC",

Patients anonymously posted their responses to pre-assigned tasks, supervised and guided by a trained moderator. Five themes around the impact of cough and mucus were explored with new questions posted every 2&ndash;3 days. On the final day, high-level conclusions were shared with patients for feedback. Data were analyzed following the principles of grounded theory.Results: Twenty COPD patients (UK, n=10; USA, n=10) participated in the Online Communities. We found that cough and mucus disrupted COPD patients&rsquo; lives at functional, emotional, social and economic levels. Patients created daily rituals and adjusted their lifestyle to cope with the impact of these symptoms. Patients identified themselves with our conclusions and saw the Online Community as an effective forum to share their experiences.Conclusion: Findings of our study add to the body of evidence on the negative impact of COPD symptoms and unmet needs of these patients.Keywords: chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cough, mucus, Online Community, online bulletin board, qualitative research",

The aim of the present study was to investigate the involvement of LINC00511 in the progression and prognosis of TNBC.Materials and methods: The expression level of LINC00511 was examined by RT-PCR in TNBC tissues and in cell lines. MTT and colony formation assays were used to examine the cell growth ability. A Boyden assay was used to examine the cell invasion ability. RNA pull-down and RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) assays were used to examine the proteins that interacted with LINC00511.Results: We demonstrated that the LINC00511 expression level was elevated in TNBC tissues when compared with that in normal breast tissues. The downregulation of LINC00511 decreased TNBC cell growth and invasion compared to those of the controls. To explore the molecular mechanisms underlying the biological activity of LINC00511, we identified proteins that bound to LINC00511 with RNA pull-down experiments. We showed that LINC00511 binds to the &beta;-transducin repeat containing (BTRC) E3 ubiquitin protein. Mechanistically, LINC00511 maintained the stability of Snail by impeding its ubiquitination and degradation by the BTRC E3 ubiquitin protein.Conclusion:&nbsp;Our data suggested that LINC00511 might serve as a novel molecular target for the treatment of TNBC.Keywords: triple-negative breast cancer, LINC00511, Snail",

Although platinum-based combination chemotherapy is commonly used as first-line treatment, the benefit of amrubicin (AMR) and salvage chemotherapy in those who develop platinum-refractory GI-NEC remains unknown. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of AMR monotherapy in patients with platinum-refractory GI-NEC.Patients and methods: Platinum-refractory GI-NEC patients who received AMR monotherapy between April 2012 and September 2017 were retrospectively analyzed. The overall response rate (ORR), progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and adverse events were evaluated. PFS and OS were estimated using Kaplan-Meier methods and compared using log-rank tests.Results: In total, 16 patients were enrolled. Of them, 13 (81.3%), 1 (6.2%), and 2 (12.5%) received cisplatin plus irinotecan, cisplatin plus etoposide, and fluoropyrimidine plus platinum, respectively, before AMR monotherapy. The primary sites of NEC included the esophagus (N=3, 18.8%), stomach (N=10, 62.5%), duodenum (N=1, 6.2%) and colorectum (N=2, 12.5%). Patients were administered a median of 3 (range, 1&ndash;15) cycles of AMR. The ORR was 6.3%, and the median PFS and OS were 2.9&nbsp;months (95% CI: 1.7&ndash;7.4) and 13.8&nbsp;months (95% CI: 7.9&ndash;23.5), respectively. Neutropenia was the most serious adverse event. Grade 3 or higher neutropenia and febrile neutropenia occurred in 50.0% and 6.2% of patients, respectively. Other nonhematological toxicities were not severe, and no treatment-related deaths occurred. The 10 patients who received subsequent chemotherapy after AMR had significantly longer OS than those who did not (17.3&nbsp;months vs 8.9&nbsp;months; p=0.018). The median PFS of those who received organ-specific subsequent chemotherapy after AMR was 3.8&nbsp;months, which was longer than that of those who received prior AMR.Conclusion: AMR is feasible with minimal side effects for platinum-refractory GI-NEC. Organ-specific subsequent chemotherapy after AMR may improve patient survival.Keywords: amrubicin monotherapy, platinum refractory, gastrointestinal neuroendocrine carcinoma",

CTCs were enriched with the CytoSorter&reg;, a microfluidic based immune capture system. CTC detection was performed before and after induction chemotherapy, as well as after surgery and\/or radiotherapy. Correlations between CTC enumerations at different time points and survival outcome and recurrence risk were evaluated. The correlation between CTCs and clinicopathological characteristics was appraised. Follow-up of patients continued until March 2019.Results: While CTCs were not found in the controls, they were detected in 24 of 31 LAHNSCC patients. CTCs could be used to distinguish diseased people from the healthy (P&lt;0.0001). CTCs were statistically associated with patient age (P=0.037, &gt;60 years old vs&lt;60 years old) and lymph node metastasis (P= 0.034, N0N1 VS N2N3). Most patients had significantly reduced CTCs at the end of treatment. Patients with partial remission of tumor after induction therapy had more CTCs than those with complete remission of tumor. Patients with higher CTCs counts prior to treatment had higher chance of developing local recurrence of tumor after treatment (P=0.0187).Conclusion: CTCs were successfully isolated in LAHNSCC patients using CytoSorter&reg; system with better sensibility. CTCs can be used to differentiate LAHNSCC patients from those with benign HNSCC tumor or healthy volunteers, and as markers to monitor patient&rsquo;s response to treatment and predict the local tumor recurrence after treatment. CTC detection at baseline has the greatest prognostic potency in LAHNSCC patients.Keywords: circulating tumor cells, head and neck carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, induction chemotherapy",

            "abstract": "Romantic relationships are a central aspect of the life of adolescents and have an important influence on the socio-affective and sexual development. This paper presents a review of the scientific literature on romantic relationships during adolescence and aims to unravel the ongoing debate in the literature and to identify possible gaps. The review encompasses the analysis of 36 studies on romantic relationships in adolescence, all published in peer-reviewed English scientific journals. The analysis of the published data was guided by five central characteristics of romantic relationships of adolescents: i.e., involvement, partner selection, content, quality, and emotions and cognitions emerging from the relationship. It was found that although during the last decade a growing interest of scholars in the study of romantic relationships in adolescents emerged, providing a certain body of knowledge on the topic in general, there are still gaps in the understanding of adolescents\u2019 romantic relationships in different socio-cultural contexts. Limitations of the reviewed studies in terms of agreement on definitions, inconsistencies in sample population, research design and methodological approach are discussed.",

Here, we review medical conditions that have been repeatedly highlighted as sharing the strongest associations with ASD\u2014epilepsy, sleep, as well as gastrointestinal and immune functioning. We describe within each condition their prevalence, associations with behavior, and evidence for successful treatment. We additionally discuss research aiming to uncover potential aetiological mechanisms. We then consider the potential interaction between each group of conditions and ASD and, based on the available evidence, propose a model that integrates these medical comorbidities in relation to potential shared aetiological mechanisms. Future research should aim to systematically examine the interactions between these physiological systems, rather than considering these in isolation, using robust and sensitive biomarkers across an individual's development. A consideration of the overlap between medical conditions and ASD may aid in defining biological subtypes within ASD and in the development of specific targeted interventions.",

Treatment regimen is generally chosen on the basis of the prevalence of bacterial resistance detected against the tested antibiotics. 60 sixty\u00a0 (60), adult out patients presented to Gastroenterology clinic of General Hospital Gashua undertook multiple gastric biopsy and specimens were carried for gram stain, culture, antimicrobial sensitivity testing, rapid urease test and histology. Antimicrobial susceptibility test were carryout using Epsilometer testing Kit (E-test) method and tested against Omeprazole, metronidazole Ranitidine, and Amoxicillin. About Sixty percent (30%) of the study population was positive for H. pylori infection (mean age of 34 years \u00b1 15), 60% were males while 40% are women which are mostly married. Helicobacter pylori culture showed a sensitivity of 55% (95% CI (29.5\u2013 62.1), specificity of 97% (95%CI (80.5\u2013100%), positive likelihood ratio of 19.93 (95% CI (1.254\u2013 317.04) and a negative likelihood ratio of 0.76 (95% CI (0.406\u20130.772). Eighteen (18) strains of Helicobacter pylori isolated 14 are sensitive to Amoxicillin, Ciprofloxacin, metronidazole; amoxicillin three (4) strains were resistant to ciprofloxacin and Amoxicillin and metronidazole when tested. It is imperative to have indebted knowledge on diagnostic method and antibiotic susceptibility patterns in the study area, since the accurate diagnosis of H. pylori is the idealistic view for both gastroenterologists and microbiologists, using synergistically invasive and noninvasive methods will be a future challenge in medical research topics. It is clear that recent advances in invasive and noninvasive methods for accurate diagnosis of the H. pylori can drastically change upcoming guidelines attributed with the management of this infection.<\/p>",

Factorial experiment has been carried out in Random Complete Block Design (RCBD) with three replications and Nine treatments have been used\u00a0 which have three potassium concentrations at 0, 3000, and 6000 mg KL-1 designated\u00a0 respectively and three copper concentrations at 0, 2.5, and 5 mg CuL-1 designated\u00a0 respectively in addition to their interactions. The treatments are applied at three different timeframes which are 45 days after sowing, 15 days after the first spraying, and 15 days after the second spraying. Vegetative growth have been collected at the maturation stage then dried to obtain dry weight and N, P, K, and Cu have been estimated in plant leaves. Tubers are harvested to measure number and yield\/plant, tubers average weight, total marketing yield and yield. The obtained data are statistically analyzed and averages are compared according to the least significant differences (LSD) at 5% level of significance and the results were as follows:\r\nThe yield components which include tubers number as compared with the control treatment.\r\nCopper foliar application significantly increase vegetative traits of the yield. The K2 treatment has given the highest significant increase of main stem vegetative growthof the components which include tubers number as compared with the control treatment.\r\nThe interaction treatments have given a significant result in terms of the both the vegetative and yield traits where K2* Cu2 give the most significant increase in term of vegetative growth while K2* Cu1 significantly increase the plant height and K1* Cu2 significantly affect the number of leaves. As for the yield component, K2*Cu2 show to have the most significant result in all traits under investigation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFinally.",

            "abstract": "Glutaredoxins (Grxs) are a ubiquitous group of oxidoreductase enzymes that are important in plant growth and development; however, the functions of rice Grxs have not been fully elucidated. In this paper, we showed that one of the Grxs, encoded by OsGrxC2.2, exhibited Grx activity. Furthermore, we demonstrated that OsGrxC2.2 was able to regulate embryo development during embryogenesis. Transgenic rice lines overexpressing OsGrxC2.2 unexpectedly exhibited degenerate embryos as well as embryoless seeds. Our data indicated that the embryonic abnormalities occurred at an early stage during embryogenesis. We found that the expression of several endodermal layer marker genes for embryo development, such as OSH1 (apical region marker), OsSCR (L2 ground tissue marker), and OsPNH1 (L3 vascular tissue marker), were significantly decreased in the OsGrxC2.2-overexpressed transgenic rice lines. In contrast, the transcript levels of the majority of protodermal layer markers, including HAZ1, ROC2, ROC3, and RAmy1A, and the shoot apical meristem marker HB, showed little change between the wild-type (WT) and OsGrxC2.2-overexpressing embryos. Surprisingly, the seed weight of the overexpressed transgenic rice was remarkably increased in comparison to that of the WT. These results indicate that the overexpression of OsGrxC2.2 interferes with the normal embryogenesis of rice embryos and leads to increased grain weight. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report that OsGrxC2.2 is a rice embryo development-associated gene.",

The absolute Seebeck coefficient S determined from the Thomson effect is highly sensitive to systematic errors incurred in the determination of the material thermal conductivity and geometry and heat loss from the sample to surroundings caused by temperature differences. Here, we report a technique for the precision measurement of S based on the Thomson effect using an ac-dc technique. This technique utilizes accurate equivalent-amplitude ac and dc currents, which can eliminate the need for acquiring accurate thermal conductivity and geometry values. These parameters can be replaced by the precisely and readily measurable parameters of electrical resistance and temperature changes caused by the Joule effect. The correction term of the heat loss owing to heat transfer via the thermocouple vanishes upon calculating the ratio of the measured temperature changes for both ac and dc excitations. We obtain an S value of -4.8 \u03bcV\/K \u00b1 0.2 \u03bcV\/K at a temperature of 300 K for platinum, which is most widely used as a reference, with an expanded relative uncertainty of 4% (2\u03c3). The obtained S value of Pt is closely consistent with that obtained from the conventional method using the Thomson effect within the uncertainty, and importantly, the measurement uncertainty improves to an acceptable level, which is four times more precise.",

            "abstract": "Early detection of various diseases is expected using surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS). For example, a method of labeling an antibody of a disease-related molecule on metal nanoparticles and detecting the SERS signals of the particles bound to the antigen is a promising approach. However, the problems of a slow antigen\u2013antibody reaction and low sensitivity remain unsolved. In this study, we fabricated nanoparticles that can be freely moved using an external magnetic field for rapid antigen\u2013antibody reaction and also nanoengineered the substrate to increase the density of hotspots required for SERS. Gold-coated magnetic nanoparticles (Au-MNPs) with a core\u2013shell structure were prepared by applying multiple coatings of gold onto magnetic iron(II,III) oxide nanoparticles, which were used as the core. A neodymium magnet easily moved and converged the Au-MNPs in the solution within a few seconds. In addition, a silver nanoparticle substrate (Ag-NS) with a hexagonal close-packed structure fixed on a polydimethylsiloxane thin film was prepared, and the stable generation of SERS was confirmed over the entire substrate. Upon aggregation of the Au-MNPs onto Ag-NS using a neodymium magnet, the total SERS strength per unit area drastically increased, suggesting that the combination of Au-MNPs and Ag-NS increased the density of the generated hotspots. In future work, with the labeling of antibodies onto Au-MNPs, we expect the proposed method to be applied in the sensitive measurement of biomarkers associated with diseases.",

But such a treatment does affect both mechanical properties and corrosion resistance. Existing studies about the effect of austenitizing on the material properties and the corrosion resistance show contradictory results. Here we reveal the different effects of austenitizing on the passive layer of stainless steel and thus the corrosion resistance, thermodynamic phase calculations, microstructure investigations and various electrochemical measurements are performed. By potentiodynamic polarization scans the pitting potential, the critical pitting potential and the corrosion current are determined. Impedance spectroscopy are used to gain deeper insight into the passive layer properties. The results show a strong dependency of the corrosion behavior on the heat treatment where the governing corrosion mechanism are affected differently.",

            "abstract": "Taking into account the wide spreading and etiopathogenetic features of the course of inflammatory diseases of periodontium and oral mucosa, it is rational to use semisolid drugs of local action, namely, dental gels. The main issue when developing this dosage form is the choice of the gel former and its concentration. Based on previous studies as the gel basis for the development of a new dental gel with \u00abPhytodent\u00bb tincture, choline salicylate 80%, and lidocaine hydrochloride the Carbomer Polacril\u00ae 40P, which is authorized for use in dentistry and has the ability to form transparent viscous aqueous-alcohol gels, has been chosen. It is known that rheological characteristics of gels directly affect the processes of release and absorption of active pharmaceutical ingredients from a semisolid dosage form, as well as its consumer properties. The important issue is the convenience and ease of application of a dental gel to inflamed tissues of periodontium and mucous membranes. This process is similar to that occurring during the shift of visco-plastic material in a rotary viscometer. The aim of the work is to study the structural and mechanical characteristics of the developed dental gel in order to select the rational concentration of the carbomer Polacril\u00ae 40P.  Materials and methods. The study objects are gel samples with different concentrations of Carbomer Polacril\u00ae 40P \u2013 1.0, 1.25, 1.5, 1.75 and 2.0 %. Measurement of the rheological parameters of the model gel samples was carried out at a temperature (25 \u00b1 0.1) \u043e\u0421 on a rotary viscometer with coaxial cylinders \"Rheolab QC\" (\"Anton Paar\") before and after contact with a solution of artificial saliva. As standards for comparison dental gels \"Dentinox-gel N\" (Germany) and gel \"Metrogyl Denta\u00ae\" (India) were selected. Results and discussion. It has been found that all gel samples have a non-Newtonian pseudoplastic flow type and are thixotropic systems with pronounced limits of fluidity. The rheological parameters of the dental gel samples increase as the concentration of Carbomer Polacril\u00ae 40P increases. In the nature of rheograms and structural viscosity the closest indicators to the drug \"Dentinox-gel N\" have gels with carbomer concentration of 1.25 % and 1.5 %, and to the drug \"Metrogyl Denta\u00ae\" \u2013 1.75 % and 2.0 %. Conclusions. Taking into account the results of structural and mechanical studies of gels with and without an artificial saliva solution, as well as in terms of profitability, the optimal concentration of Carbomer Polacril\u00ae 40P in the composition of the developed gel was chosen to be 1.5 %.",

Given that EMTs consider safety the first priority, they must pay adequate attention to their own physical well-being and fitness to practice.\u00a0Objective: The present study was conducted to analyze the fitness of Jordanian EMTs.\u00a0Method: The present prospective study was conducted to evaluate the well-being of Jordanian paramedics. The survey was designed using Google forms, which were completed by the participants. The data collection tools comprised an already-designed checklist, including items such as age, gender as well as height and weight, which are used for calculating body mass index (BMI). In addition, the presence of chronic diseases such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, renal failure and cardiorespiratory diseases as well as the history of surgeries and disabilities were investigated. The participants were also asked about their smoking status and other health-related habits.\u00a0Results: Out of 115 surveys conducted, 7 were discarded owing to loss of information or making completion mistakes. Out of the remaining 108 respondents, 82 (75.9%) were male and below 10% were over the age of 30 years. BMI was over 25 in 40.7% of the respondents, and only 4 (3.7%) had chronic diseases. Moreover, 46 (42.6%) respondents were smokers, and only 30 (27.8%) performed regular exercise.\u00a0Conclusion: The present findings suggest health problems in a small percentage of the EMTs, potentially due to the appropriate support provided by the employers or university authorities in this regard. The major health problem was overweight and unhealthy lifestyle, including smoking and not doing regular exercise.\n",

Since tourists consume products and services and return visit\/s and sustainability is desired by destinations, it is important to identify variables that influence the motivation, behaviour and satisfaction levels of tourists. The town of Clarens which is situated in the foothills of the Maluti Mountains in the Free State province of South Africa was the focus of this research study. It is labelled as the \"Jewel of the Eastern Free State\". Using a questionnaire survey, the researchers categorized tourists according to their demographic and socio-economic characteristics.  Disconfirmation of expectations was measured using five point Likert-scales against eighteen selected variables. The findings of this study suggested that tourists were mostly satisfied with facilities, natural attractions and relaxation facilities provided by the destination. In essence, nature and adventure were experienced very positively. In contrast, tourists were disappointed with facilities such as local transport services, cleanliness and safety and security. The difference between tourist expectation and experience was diverse for different groups \u2013 for example inter alia, gender, age, international or local origin, but most of these differences were not significant. The findings presented should contribute to the development of tourism strategies which are intended to empower the town to better recognize and respond to the dynamic demand patterns of tourists and potential visitors from both the domestic and foreign market. These strategies aim towards sustainable tourism development in Clarens and the surrounding area. ",

            "abstract": "Abstract The intensity of Atlantic Ocean hurricanes is predicted to increase, and although disturbance is recognized as a fundamental driver of ecological processes, the benefits of hurricanes to ecological systems are seldom acknowledged. In October 2012, Hurricane Sandy overwashed Fire Island and Westhampton Island, New York. The storm flattened dunes, buried vegetation, and breached the barrier islands in several places. To reduce future overwashing, engineers attempted to stabilize the islands. We studied nest\u2010site selection, suitable habitat, and abundance of a threatened shorebird, the piping plover (Charadrius melodus), before and after Hurricane Sandy. Prior to the hurricane, piping plovers selected nest sites (n\u00a0=\u00a062) farther from the ocean (x\u00af least\u2010cost distance\u00a0=\u00a082.8\u00a0m) and bay (x\u00af Euclidean distance\u00a0=\u00a0697.7\u00a0m; x\u00af least\u2010cost distance\u00a0=\u00a024,160.6\u00a0m) than would be expected if they were selecting nest sites at random. Following the hurricane, piping plovers selected nest sites (n\u00a0=\u00a045) predominantly in or near storm overwash habitat, which was close to, and had unobstructed walking access to, the ocean (x\u00af least\u2010cost distance\u00a0=\u00a0123.4\u00a0m) and newly created bayside foraging habitats (x\u00af Euclidean distance\u00a0=\u00a0468.0\u00a0m; x\u00af least\u2010cost distance\u00a0=\u00a0728.9\u00a0m). Areas overwashed by the hurricane contained the most suitable piping plover habitat across all new habitat types. Piping plover abundance increased 93% by 2018 from pre\u2010Hurricane Sandy abundances, with most pairs nesting in new habitats. However, only 58% of suitable piping plover habitat was protected from recreational use and few piping plovers used unprotected habitats for nesting. Our results suggest that the ecological benefits of increased storminess may be maximized by coupling coastal stabilization with targeted conservation of storm\u2010created habitats.",

            "title": "Somatosensory Cross-Modal Reorganization in Children With Cochlear Implants",
            "abstract": "Deprived of sensory input, as in deafness, the brain tends to reorganize. Cross-modal reorganization occurs when cortices associated with deficient sensory modalities are recruited by other, intact senses for processing of the latter\u2019s sensory input. Studies have shown that this type of reorganization may affect outcomes when sensory stimulation is later introduced via intervention devices. One such device is the cochlear implant (CI). Hundreds of thousands of CIs have been fitted on people with hearing impairment worldwide, many of them children. Factors such as age of implantation have proven useful in predicting speech perception outcome with these devices in children. However, a portion of the variance in speech understanding ability remains unexplained. It is possible that the degree of cross-modal reorganization may explain additional variability in listening outcomes. Thus, the current study aimed to examine possible somatosensory cross-modal reorganization of the auditory cortices. To this end we used high density EEG to record cortical responses to vibrotactile stimuli in children with normal hearing (NH) and those with CIs. We first investigated cortical somatosensory evoked potentials (CSEP) in NH children, in order to establish normal patterns of CSEP waveform morphology and sources of cortical activity. We then compared CSEP waveforms and estimations of cortical sources between NH children and those with CIs to assess the degree of somatosensory cross-modal reorganization. Results showed that NH children showed expected patterns of CSEP and current density reconstructions, such that postcentral cortices were activated contralaterally to the side of stimulation. Participants with CIs also showed this pattern of activity. However, in addition, they showed activation of auditory cortical areas in response to somatosensory stimulation. Additionally, certain CSEP waveform components were significantly earlier in the CI group than the children with NH. These results are taken as evidence of cross-modal reorganization by the somatosensory modality in children with CIs. Speech perception in noise scores were negatively associated with CSEP waveform components latencies in the CI group, suggesting that the degree of cross-modal reorganization is related to speech perception outcomes. These findings may have implications for clinical rehabilitation in children with cochlear implants.",

            "abstract": "There are numerous precedents for the application of strategic planning and integrated planning systems to different areas of natural resource management. The clearest and most obvious antecedent is the European Territorial Strategy, consisting of an ambitious project and effort to homogenize terminology and a technical convention on territorial and urban planning, in which all the countries of the European Union have been involved. The model of the European Territorial Strategy is undoubtedly a very valid model, both as a methodology of work and as a system of consultation between the research class and the political class of the countries involved. With regard to the strategic planning of water resources and water management, evidently existing experiences are scarce. It must be borne in mind that to date the management of water resources and watersheds has had a very sectoral nature and has been very restricted to the scope of action of the respective government institutions responsible for the management, that is, the Hydrographic Confederations in the Spanish case and the National Water Institute (NWI) in the Portuguese case. For this reason, this study analyzes the European Territorial Strategy as a starting point to establish cross-border cooperation between Spanish and Portuguese in the management of water resources, establishing after this analysis the methodological proposals to be followed to address and specify such transnational border cooperation, in favor of the management of the water resources of the Iberian Peninsula.",

A new species is described from western Arkansas and eastern Oklahoma, USA, Perlesta sublobata South &amp;amp; DeWalt, sp. nov., from the adult male, adult female, and egg. Perlesta sublobata males are differentiated from other congeners by a combination of a prominent ventral caecum and a distinct dorsal extension of the lateral sclerites of the aedeagus. A preliminary molecular phylogenetic hypothesis is proposed for Perlesta based on 17 congeners and three outgroup taxa using partial mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I sequence data. Illustrations, stereomicroscope images, and scanning electron micrographs support the description and comparison to other Perlesta.\n      ",

            "abstract": "Purpose - CEOs\u2019 (chief executive officer) term of office may explain discretionary accruals as a result of opportunistic behavior arising during certain periods of the term of office. Therefore, CEOs, in their early years of office, have incentives to report results that meet market expectations. In turn, CEOs in their senior year may be motivated to use discretionary accruals to gain private benefits. In this scenario, corporate governance mechanisms play an important role in monitoring relationships. Hence, the purpose of this study is to verify the influence of monitoring mechanisms on the relationship between CEOs\u2019 term of office and discretionary accruals. Design\/methodology\/approach - Descriptive statistics, multiple cross-sectional regression to estimate the accruals and regression of panel data to test the hypotheses were used. The sample comprised 195 companies listed on BM&FBovespa. Findings - The results indicated that CEOs\u2019 long term of office has a negative impact on the level of discretionary accruals, and thus, Brazilian CEOs with a longer term of office tend to establish a certain reputation in the stock market. On the other hand, it is concluded that CEOs\u2019 intentions, in the first years of term, are positively related to the use of accruals and that the monitoring mechanisms can minimize these CEOs\u2019 opportunistic practices. Originality\/value - The results broaden the literature on corporate governance, pointing that different systems of variable remuneration may influence CEOs\u2019 willingness to manage results in their last year of term.",

This paper aims to compare the supply chain structure of traditional automotive industry with the supply chains from South Korea and China. Based on strategic decision and transaction cost theory, this comparison seeks to exploit the factors that led to the inefficiency of automotive supply chains. Design\/methodology\/approach - The authors used a qualitative approach and applied a multi-method research. They conducted semi-structured interviews with six executives from automakers representing the selected countries, carried individual meetings during one workshop and used secondary data from several sources. Findings - Concepts identified in the research such as reliability, supply chain governance and automaker competencies led the authors to propose that the traditional automakers have higher transaction costs when compared to the new automakers due to the horizontal structure of their supply chain. While new competitors have vertical upstream supply chains, which indicates better profitability, traditional automotive industry is horizontal, depends on fewer Tier 1 suppliers and is disconnected from Tier 2, impacting negatively in the transaction costs and supply chain management. Practical implications - This study suggests that automotive executives rethink the current upstream supply chain model by identifying the competencies required for their current and future competitiveness and implementing a vertical integration of these competencies. Originality\/value - This research exploited the inefficiency of supply chain as one of the explanations for the low competitiveness of the national automotive industry.",

While new competitors have vertical upstream supply chains, which indicates better profitability, traditional automotive industry is horizontal, depends on fewer Tier 1 suppliers and is disconnected from Tier 2, impacting negatively in the transaction costs and supply chain management. Practical implications - This study suggests that automotive executives rethink the current upstream supply chain model by identifying the competencies required for their current and future competitiveness and implementing a vertical integration of these competencies. Originality\/value - This research exploited the inefficiency of supply chain as one of the explanations for the low competitiveness of the national automotive industry.",

            "abstract": "Dalam konteks fikih muamalah, terdapat dua terminologi yang berkaitan dengan hukum perikatan, yaitu akad dan wa\u2019ad (janji). Ulama sepakat bahwa terbentuknya transkasi apabila terpenuhinya kompenen dari akad tersebut, yakni rukun dan syarat sahnya suatu akad. Akan tetapi, ulama berbeda pendapat mengenai hukum wa\u2019ad (janji) dan muw\u00e2\u2019adah (saling berjanji). Perbedaan tersebut dilatarbelakang mengenai hukum janji itu mengikat atau tidak mengikat dalam sebuah transkasi. Dalam tataran implementasinya, terdapat beberapa fatwa DSN-MUI yang mengyinggung mengenai konsep wa\u2019ad (janji). Hasil kesimpulan menunjukan bahwa; pertama, wa\u2019ad adalah \u201cPernyataan dari pihak\/ seseorang (subyek hukum) untuk berbuat\/tidak berbuat sesuatu; serta perbuatan tersebut dilakukan di masa yang akan datang (istiqb\u00e2l)\u201d. Para ulama berbeda pendapat mengenai hukum menunaikan wa\u2019ad (janji); kedua, dalam konteks fatwa DSN-MUI, terdapat sejumlah fatwa yang berkaitan dengan implementasi konsep wa\u2019ad, yaitu (1) Fatwa DSN-MUI Nomor: 4\/DSN-MUI\/IV\/2000 tentang Mur\u00e2bahah; (2) fatwa DSN-MUI Nomor: 27\/DSN-MUI\/III\/2002 tentang IMBT; (3) fatwa DSN-MUI Nomor: 73\/DSN-MUI\/XI\/2008 tentang MMQ; (4) fatwa DSN-MUI Nomor; 55\/DSN-MUI\/V\/2007 tentang PRKS; (5) fatwa DSN-MUI Nomor 28\/DSN-MUI\/III\/2002 tentang Jual Bli Mata Uang (Al-Sharf).",

Kedua, Terdapat dua pendapat dalam hal ini, pihak yang berpendapat bahwa pajak dibolehkan dalam Islam setelah kewajiban zakat.

The paper introduces a general framework for the analysis of various droop control configurations employed in MTDC systems. This framework is then used to compare leading droop control configurations in terms of their impact on the relative stability, performance and robustness of the overall MTDC system. A generalized analytical MTDC model that contains detailed models of AC and DC system components is derived. Limitations imposed by DC power flow, DC inductor, cable modeling and AC network impedance on DC system stability are identified. Classical and multivariable frequency response analysis and eigenvalue analysis are applied to open-loop and closed-loop models to compare the stability and robustness of five leading droop controllers, with the focus on feedback signal selection and controller parameterization. This paper also proposes an active stabilizing controller, which takes the form of a modified constant power control, to enhance the controllability and robustness of the DC voltage control.",

The method used in this study is qualitative descriptive. Perception of students of UKAI Ar-Ribath campus missionary activists towards the four pillars of nation and state, that Pancasila, Bhinneka Tunggal Ika, UUD 45 and the Unitary State of the Republic of Indonesia are ijtihad from the founding fathers in forming a sovereign and just country. So that Indonesia which consists of many tribes, customs, races, and religions can unite into one nation, one nation, and one language. Their perception of the radical Islamic movement is that they do not support because good will be truly channeled well if done with wisdom and wisdom, not by means of violence. They also disagreed with the ISIS movement, HTI, FPI, MMI, Anshorut Tauhid, because their movement was very disturbing to the citizens.\n\n\u00a0\n\nKeywords: Campus Da\u201fwah Institution, Four National and State Pillars, Radical Islamic Movement.\n\n\u00a0\nAbstrak\n\nPenelitian ini bertujuan untuk mengetahui persepsi mahasiswa aktivis lembaga dakwah kampus UKAI Ar-Ribath tentang empat pilar berbangsa dan bernegara, serta gerakan Islam radikal di Universitas Tidar. Metode yang digunakan dalam penelitian ini deskriptif kualitatif.

No obstante, parece no haber una clara evidencia que apoye esta pr\u00e1ctica. El prop\u00f3sito principal de este art\u00edculo es contestar a la pregunta: \u00bfCu\u00e1l es la evidencia que sustenta la colocaci\u00f3n del taponamiento far\u00edngeo por parte de los anestesistas?\n\r\n\nPara ello se llev\u00f3 a cabo una revisi\u00f3n sistem\u00e1tica y b\u00fasqueda bibliogr\u00e1fica, que no consiguieron encontrar evidencia cient\u00edfica de calidad que avalase el uso del taponamiento. Sin embargo, se encontraron varios art\u00edculos en los que se expon\u00edan complicaciones de diversa gravedad y se ofrec\u00edan recomendaciones sobre c\u00f3mo evitarlas.\n\r\n\nTras los resultados de esta b\u00fasqueda, los autores del estudio no recomiendan la inserci\u00f3n rutinaria del taponamiento por parte de los anestesistas y aconsejan una indicaci\u00f3n cuidadosa.

A\u00a0systematic review and\u00a0consensus document\n\r\n\n\u00a0\n\r\n\nThe insertion of throat packs is a procedure commonly performed by anaesthetists for dental, maxillofacial, nasal or upper airway surgery. However, the evidence supporting this practice is unclear. The aim of this article is to answer the following question: Is there enough evidence about the insertion of throat packs by anaesthetists?\n\r\n\nConsequently, the authors conducted a systematic review and literature search and they could find no study that sought to assess the benefit of their insertion by anaesthetists. Instead, there were many reports of minor and mayor complications and many descriptions of how to avoid them.\n\r\n\nAs a result of these findings, the authors no longer recommend the routine insertion of throat packs by anaesthetist but advise caution and careful consideration. A protocol for pack insertion is presented.",

Su mortalidad puede alcanzar\u00a0 el 20% (1,3).\n\r\n\nLas hip\u00f3tesis propuestas para el desarrollo de dicha entidad incluyen, el aumento de la permeabilidad de la microvasculatura pulmonar, cambios en el flujo linf\u00e1tico, disminuci\u00f3n de la producci\u00f3n de surfactante y aumento de la presi\u00f3n hidrost\u00e1tica del flujo vascular del pulm\u00f3n reexpandido (4).\n\r\n\nSe caracteriza por el desarrollo agudo de hipoxemia refractaria al ox\u00edgeno y la aparici\u00f3n de infiltrados alveolares intersticiales en un plazo de 24 horas tras el drenaje (5).\n\r\n\nSon factores de riesgo de REPE: la edad comprendida entre los 20 y 40 a\u00f1os, la duraci\u00f3n del colapso pulmonar mayor de 72 horas, la aplicaci\u00f3n de altas presiones negativas durante la toracocentesis (20 cm H2O), una r\u00e1pida reexpansi\u00f3n tras drenajes de altos vol\u00famenes de l\u00edquido pleural (> 1.5 L) o la existencia de factores predisponentes para el edema pulmonar (hipoalbuminemia, estasis en la circulaci\u00f3n pulmonar).\n\r\n\nABSTRACT\n\r\n\nIntraoperative reexpansion pulmonary edema \u201cREPE\u201d following thoracoscopy by one lung ventilation\n\r\n\nThe sudden pulmonar expansion which has remained collapsed among different hours or days, likewise the fast pneumothorax or pleural effusion drainage, can cause a flash or acute edema on the affected lung.\n\r\n\nIt is believed that the rexpansive pulmonary syndrome (REPE), is caused due to an increment in the capillary permeability after being exposed the affected lung to high negative intra-pleural pressure.\n\r\n\nThe ocurrence of REPE is a rare event with most cohort studies reporting an incidence of between 0%- 1%. It may extend with hypoxaemia, hypotension and even cardiac arrest.\n\r\n\nThe treatment of these patients include mechanical ventilation with optimal PEEP levels, the use of vasopressors and an intesive electrolyte resuscitation.\n\r\n\nWe expose the case of a 16 year old patient with mediastinal mass diagnosis and massive left-pleural effusion, where after a thorascocopy for biopsy and pleuritic drainage, it is observed a reexpansion pulmonary edema with respiratory repercussion, haemodynamics and the requirement of endotracheal reintubation.",

            "abstract": "Introduction: Computed tomography simulation imaging is a processing for treatment plan that may cause patients high radiation dose receiving. Thus, exposure techniques variation could reduce dose risk.\n\r\n\nObjectives: Purpose of this study was to study effect of exposure technique on image quality and radiation dose (CTDIvol and effective dose) from CT simulation image of chest.\n\r\n\nMaterials and methods: Exposure parameters (tube voltage, tube current and slice thickness) were varied to achieve low radiation dose with equal reference image quality (120 kVp, 100 mAs). In this study, chest phantom was used. Scanning parameters were 90, 120,140 kVp, in which each kVp was varied to 50, 100, 150 mAs and slice thickness at 3 mm and 5 mm were tested. CTDIvol from each scan was recorded. Effective dose of chest and breast was calculated by impact scan program. Image noise was measured in lung and heart regions. Image quality was evaluated by 2 radiation oncologists.\n\r\n\nResults: The results showed that kVp and mAs were affected to radiation dose. mAs was direct proportional to while kVp increased radiation dose. In addition, image noise measured in heart and lung region with increasing kVp or mAs, were reduced. Moreover, 3 mm-slice thickness showed higher noise than 5 mm-slice thickness.\n\r\n\nConclusion: The recommended exposure parameters for computed tomography simulation assessed by radiation oncologists were 140 kVp, 50 mAs for 3 mm- and 5 mm-slice thickness, respectively. The radiation dose reduced 26.35% (5.92 to 4.36 mGy) from reference exposure technique. Effective dose of chest and breast were 0.7 and 0.57 mSv, respectively.\n\r\nBull Chiang Mai Assoc Med Sci 2016; 49(2): 245-254. Doi: 10.14456\/jams.2016.16",

This distribution allows a stable and spatially circumscribed organization, but facilitates the appearance of \"peripheral\" patients.\nIt was studied whether peripheral Internal Medicine patients had worse health care and economic outcomes than those admitted to their own beds.\nMaterials and methods\nRetrospective observational study involving patients admitted from January 1 to March 15 and discharged before 1 April 2015. Hospital readmissions, length of stay and mortality of hospitalized patients in the beds of Internal Medicine Service were compared against the peripheral. Used as control variables age, sex, number of diagnoses at discharge and Charlson comorbidity index.\nResults\nThe study included 1045 patients, 27.8% (95% CI 25.1 to 30.6) peripherals. Mortality in both groups did not differ significantly (OR 0.8 [95% CI 0.5 to 1.3]), but they did readmissions (OR 1.6 [95% CI 1 to 2.5]; p = 0.037) and length of stay (1 [95% CI 0.1 to 1.8]; p = 0.034). This represented an increase of 51.2% in readmissions and 12.2% in length of stay. Excess of hospitalization days has led to an increase in spending \u20ac 157,703.3.\nConclusions\nPeripheral Internal Medicine patients have worse outcomes than inpatient care in their own beds, with an increase in associated costs.",

            "abstract": "ABSTRACT \nMucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma is an extranodal lymphoma arising in a number of epithelial tissues, including stomach, salivary gland and the lung. Pulmonary MALT lymphoma originates in the parenchyma and\/or bronchi and is a rare disease, representing 0.5-1% of primary pulmonary malignancies. Although the time to diagnosis can be delayed because most patients are asymptomatic and investigations are usually driven by the accidental finding of abnormal lung imaging studies, it has an indolent course and a good prognosis. Here we report the case of an asymptomatic female patient with a nodular lung opacity that was found to persist five months after an episode of community-acquired pneumonia. A final diagnosis of pulmonary MALT lymphoma was obtained after an extensive diagnostic work-up. \n\nRESUMO:\nO linfoma do tecido linf\u00f3ide associado \u00e0 mucosa (MALT) \u00e9 um linfoma extranodal que surge em v\u00e1rios tecidos epiteliais, incluindo o est\u00f4mago, as gl\u00e2ndulas salivares e o pulm\u00e3o. O linfoma MALT pulmonar tem origem no par\u00eanquima e\/ou br\u00f4nquios e \u00e9 raro, representando 0.5-1% dos tumors prim\u00e1rios do pulm\u00e3o. Pode haver um atraso no tempo at\u00e9 ao diagn\u00f3stico porque a maioria dos pacientes \u00e9 assintom\u00e1tica, sendo as investiga\u00e7\u00f5es geralmente conduzidas pelo achado acidental de exames de imagem pulmonares alterados. Este linfoma tem um curso indolente e um bom progn\u00f3stico. Aqui expomos o caso de uma paciente assintom\u00e1tica com uma opacidade nodular que persistiu 5 meses ap\u00f3s um epis\u00f3dio de pneumonia adquirida na comunidade. O diagn\u00f3stico final de linfoma MALT pulmonar foi obtido ap\u00f3s uma investiga\u00e7\u00e3o diagn\u00f3stica extensa.",

Both groups were age and gender matched. Participants in Tai Chi group practiced Tai Chi at home for 50 minutes per session, 3 times a week for 12 consecutive weeks. Postural sway was evaluated under 4 conditions (stand with eyes open on floor, eyes closed on floor, eyes open on foam, eyes closed on foam). Trunk coordination stability was evaluated using Lord sway meter. All evaluations were performed before and after 12-week period. Student\u2019s t-tests were conducted to compare differences of each outcome measure between and within groups. Significance level was set at p\u22640.05.\n\r\nResults: After 12-week Tai Chi training, the Tai Chi group demonstrated significant improvement from baseline in all outcome variables (p<0.05). In contrast, the control group showed no significant differences in all outcome variables when compared between baseline and at 12-week period (p>0.05). Due to baseline differences between groups, outcome measures were normalized to their baseline values for between-group comparisons at 12-week period. Results showed that postural sway tested while standing on floor under both eyes open and eyes closed conditions as well as trunk coordination stability significantly improved for the Tai Chi group as compared to controls (p<0.05). There were no significant differences in postural sway between two groups for foam conditions both under eyes open and eyes closed (p>0.05). Specifically, there was a trend for participants in Tai Chi group to decrease postural sway from baseline more than those in control group when tested with eyes open on foam (p=0.061) while there was no significant difference in postural sway with eyes closed on foam conditions between groups (p=0.242).\n\r\nConclusion: Home-based Tai Chi training for 50 minutes per session, 3 times per week for 12 consecutive weeks could improve balance in older adults with MCI.\n\r\nBull Chiang Mai Assoc Med Sci 2016; 49(1): 123-133.\u00a0Doi: 10.14456\/jams.2016.6",

            "abstract": "Introduction: Leukemia is a hematologic malignant disease. To date, chemotherapy is the most effective method for leukemia treatment. However, multidrug resistance (MDR) is a major obstacle of leukemia treatment failure. Previous studies have shown that multidrug resistance phenotype is associated with P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and survivin which is a drug transporter protein and inhibitors of apoptosis proteins (IAPs), respectively. Moreover, overexpressed CD147 has been reported to be involved in the multidrug resistance cell lines. However, the relationship of P-gp, survivin, and CD147 in leukemia with MDR phenotype have not been reported.\n\nObjective: The purpose of this study was to investigate the expressions of P-gp, survivin and CD147 in leukemic cells with MDR phenotype K562\/Adr compared to drug sensitive K562 cells.\n\nMaterials and methods: The sensitivity of the adriamycin on K562\/Adr (drug resistance) and K562 (drug sensitive) cells were determined by MTT assay. Expressions of P-gp, survivin, and CD147 were then investigated by RT-PCR and Western blotting.\n\nResults:\u00a0 Adriamycin showed the cytotoxic effect on K562 cells more than K562\/Adr cells with the inhibitory concentration at 50% growth (IC50) values of 2.17\u00b11.02 \u00b5M and >10 \u00b5M, respectively. P-gp, survivin, and CD147 showed the significant increase in both protein and mRNA levels in K562\/Adr cells by Western blot and RT-PCR.\n\nConclusion: This study is the first report describing the high level expression of P-gp, survivin, and CD147 in leukemia with multidrug resistance phenotype.\n\nBull Chiang Mai Assoc Med Sci 2015; 48(3): 173-181.\u00a0Doi: 10.14456\/jams.2015.21",

Based on a review of the state-of-the-art in online analysis and discussion of distributed data processing and computation architecture patterns, a new online analysis architecture is proposed. The primary goal of the new architecture is to increase the online analysis response speed to the order of seconds. A reference implementation of the proposed online analysis architecture to validate the feasibility of implementing the architecture and some performance testing results are presented.",

In spite of decline in child mortality rate and with huge progress in the field of neonatal medicine, neonatal and specially early neonatal death are one of the important causes of infant mortality rate so evaluating the causes of neonatal death and specially early neonatal death is very important in every geographic area .Therefore we decided to evaluate the early neonatal mortality rate and find out their etiologies in one of the referral hospital in Tehran.\nMethods: This is a retrospective and descriptive study which had been done In neonatal ward and neonatal intensive care unit of Shariati hospital during 8 years. All neonates who were born in this time period and expired within first week of life were evaluated for causes and time of death .registered information were analyzed.\nResults: 2050 neonates were born and 189 early neonatal death were recorded. More than half of dead neonates were under 2500 gram weight at birth and the most prevalent cause of death were respiratory diseases and then congenital anomalies.\nConclusion: Because the most important cause of early neonatal death was low birth weight, maternal support during pregnancy and appropriate monitoring of fetal weight and health play an important role in declining neonatal mortality .Proper intervention for treatment of neonatal respiratory diseases will decrease neonatal death.",

The purpose of this study was to evaluate basal metabolic concentrations of cerebellum, including N-acetyl aspartate (NAA) and Cholin(Cho) in athletes and compare them with non-athlete subjects.\nMaterials and Methods: In this quasi-experimental study, 10 young wrestlers (age,21.71\u00b12.06 years; weight,71.31 \u00b15.59; BMI,23.9 \u00b11.04; VO2max,56.03 \u00b12.41) and a history of wrestling exercises of at least 4 years, from Available community as an athlete group and 9 people (age,21.16\u00b11.94 years; BMI, 24.02\u00b12.38; VO2max,41.25 \u00b12.45)They did not have a history of regular exercise as non-athletic groups, After conducting baseline assessments in the field of body composition\u00a0 and aerobic fitness, both groups performed MRS test to determine the values of NAA and Cho. Data were analyzed using independent t-tests at significance level of p<0.05.\nFindings: In this study, the NAA\/Cr levels of the athletes cerebellum (wrestlers) increased compared to the non-athlete group, and the results showed a significant difference between the two groups (0.047). However, the cerebellar Cho\/ Cr levels of athletes and Non-athletes were not significantly different in spite of the increase (0.777).\nConclusion: Based on the results of this study cerebellar neuro-metabolites in athletes showed higher levels compared to non-athlete groups.",

            "abstract": "Background: Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) lead to abnormalities in fetal central nervous system, till hippocampal and cortical cells became apoptotic. The goal of this research is investigating the effects of Gallic acid on improvement of cognitive impairments and nuclear factor kappa B (NF\u0199B) in animal model of IUGR.\nMaterial and Methods: In this experimental study, 32 female rats from wistar race with weighing approximately 180\u00b125g were divided into 4 groups of 7 .Control group: that did not receive any treatment . IUGR group: To induce IUGR of pregnant rats were under 50 % restricted diet from the 14th day of pregnancy to childbirth. Experimental groups 1 and 2: pregnant rats subjected to a 50 % dietary restriction for induction IUGR from 14th day of pregnancy to childbirth and from 12th day of pregnancy to the birth of newborns, received 200 and 400 mg\/kg gallic acid doses daily by gavage method. After the birth of pups, morphological evaluations were checked. Then, in 30 postnatal days working and passive avoidance tests and anxiety test were assessed. The serum level of NF\u0199B was analyzed by ELISA.\nResults: The working memory and fear-based memory of IUGR rats was reduced significantly compared to the controls. In addition restricted diet leads to increase in NF\u0199B and anxiety levels. Gallic acid was ameliorated working and fear-based memories and reduced serum level of NF\u0199B and anxiety in treated rats.\nConclusion: The findings suggest that restricted diet during pregnancy can cause behavioral cognitive disorders in rats. This is likely due to increased levels of pro-apoptic cytokine such as NF\u0199B. The results also suggest that the neuroprotective effect of Gallic acid is likely to improve memory disorders in IUGR rat model.",

            "abstract": "Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a progressive disorder of the lung parenchyma which also involves extrapulmonary manifestations, such as cardiovascular impairment, diaphragm dysfunction, and frequent exacerbations. The development of animal models is important to elucidate the pathophysiology of COPD exacerbations and enable analysis of possible therapeutic approaches. We aimed to characterize a model of acute emphysema exacerbation and evaluate its consequences on the lung, heart, and diaphragm. Twenty-four Wistar rats were randomly assigned into one of two groups: control (C) or emphysema (ELA). In ELA group, animals received four intratracheal instillations of pancreatic porcine elastase (PPE) at 1-week intervals. The C group received saline under the same protocol. Five weeks after the last instillation, C and ELA animals received saline (SAL) or E. coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (200 \u03bcg in 200 \u03bcl) intratracheally. Twenty-four hours after saline or endotoxin administration, arterial blood gases, lung inflammation and morphometry, collagen fiber content, and lung mechanics were analyzed. Echocardiography, diaphragm ultrasonography (US), and computed tomography (CT) of the chest were done. ELA-LPS animals, compared to ELA-SAL, exhibited decreased arterial oxygenation; increases in alveolar collapse (p &lt; 0.0001), relative neutrophil counts (p = 0.007), levels of cytokine-induced neutrophil chemoattractant-1, interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2, tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, IL-6, and vascular endothelial growth factor in lung tissue, collagen fiber deposition in alveolar septa, airways, and pulmonary vessel walls, and dynamic lung elastance (p &lt; 0.0001); reduced pulmonary acceleration time\/ejection time ratio, (an indirect index of pulmonary arterial hypertension); decreased diaphragm thickening fraction and excursion; and areas of emphysema associated with heterogeneous alveolar opacities on chest CT. In conclusion, we developed a model of endotoxin-induced emphysema exacerbation that affected not only the lungs but also the heart and diaphragm, thus resembling several features of human disease. This model of emphysema should allow preclinical testing of novel therapies with potential for translation into clinical practice.",

Data analysis was performed using descriptive statistics, point biserial correlation, Spearman rank correlation coefficient and multiple regression analysis.\n\r\nResults: The results revealed that mean scores of overall QOL of life, health and functional ability, psychological\/ spiritual, social and economic and family dimensions of participants were at a moderate level. Factors including personel relationship with people in community, care giver environments and muscle power of upper extremity were shown significantly correlated with the quality of life in stroke survivors as same as the level of severity and level of activity daily living (p<0.05). In addition, independent factors include co-morbidity, drinking alcohol, care giver, duration of caring, duration of stroke and level of severity were significantly influencing the predictors of quality of life of stroke survivors (p<0.05).\n\r\n\nConclusion: The findings can be used as a guide to develop rehabilitation programs to improve overall quality of life.",

            "abstract": "Background: From biomechanical dimension, working position of dentist is a prolonged trunk forward bending and forward shoulder posture during clinical practice. It can be assumed that dentists have a high risk of neck or shoulder pain, and upper thoracic pain. These conditions may lead to upper crossed syndrome (UCS) which is consisted of pectoral and neck extensor muscles tightness with scapular and neck flexor muscles weakness.\n\r\nObjectives: To determine craniovertebral angle, pectoralis minor length test, craniocervical flexion test, and scapular muscles strength tests in dental students.\n\r\nMaterials and methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted in 220 dental students in 1-6 grades at KhonKaen University. The participants were received physical examination. Length testing of neck extensor muscles was measured by craniovertebral angle, length testing of pectoral muscles was measured by pectoralis minor length test, strength of neck flexor muscles was measured by craniocervical flexion test, and strength of scapular muscles was measured by handheld dynamometer.\n\r\n\nResults: The result found that the average craniovertebral angle was 50.76\u00b16.99 degrees. The average length of pectoralis minor muscles were 5.44\u00b11.29 and 5.46\u00b12.14 centimeters, on right and left side, respectively. The average strength of neck flexor muscles was 28.55\u00b1 2.29 millimeter of mercury (mmHg). The average strength of scapular muscles which consist of 1) serratus anterior muscles were 7.99\u00b12.08 kilogram (kg) on the right side and 7.77\u00b12.19 kg on the left side 2) rhomboid muscles were 10.03\u00b12.83 kg on the right side and 9.86\u00b12.79 kg on the left side 3) middle trapezius muscles were 12.79\u00b12.57 kg on the right side and 12.66\u00b12.55 kg on the left side 4) lower trapezius muscles were 12.43\u00b12.41 kg on the right side and 12.58\u00b12.39 kg on the left side.\n\r\n\nConclusion: Dental students trend to have tightness of neck extensor and pectoral muscles, whereas strength of neck flexor and scapular muscle are normal.",

Growth cones are thought to play a critical role during development of neurons. Growth cones also play a significant role in adult regeneration. Here, we present a dataset on the lipid and protein profiling of the growth cone-enriched fractions derived from C57BL\/6J mice forebrains of developmental stage: E18, P0, P3, P6, and P9. For comparison, we analyzed non-growth cone membranes from the same samples. Lipid data is available at the Metabolomics Workbench [http:\/\/www.metabolomicsworkbench.org (Project ID: PR000746)]. Protein data is available at Proteomics Identifications (PRIDE) partner repository (PRIDE identifier PXD012134).

            "abstract": "Pyruvate dehydrogenase kinases (PDK1-4) play a critical role in the inhibition of the mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase complex especially when blood glucose levels are low and pyruvate can be conserved for gluconeogenesis. Under diabetic conditions, the Pdk genes, particularly Pdk4, are often induced, and the elevation of the Pdk4 gene expression has been implicated in the increased gluconeogenesis in the liver and the decreased glucose utilization in the peripheral tissues. However, there is no direct evidence yet to show to what extent that the dysregulation of hepatic Pdk genes attributes to hyperglycemia and insulin resistance in vivo. To address this question, we crossed Pdk2 or Pdk4 null mice with a diabetic model that is deficient in hepatic insulin receptor substrates 1 and 2 (Irs1\/2). Metabolic analyses reveal that deletion of the Pdk4 gene had better improvement in hyperglycemia and glucose tolerance than knockout of the Pdk2 gene whereas the Pdk2 gene deletion showed better insulin tolerance as compared to the Pdk4 gene inactivation on the Irs1\/2 knockout genetic background. To examine the specific hepatic effects of Pdks on diabetes, we also knocked down the Pdk2 or Pdk4 gene using specific shRNAs. The data also indicate that the Pdk4 gene knockdown led to better glucose tolerance than the Pdk2 gene knockdown. In conclusion, our data suggest that hepatic Pdk4 may be critically involved in the pathogenesis of diabetes.",

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND:According to the body-specificity hypothesis, people with different bodily characteristics should form correspondingly different mental representations, even in highly abstract conceptual domains. In a previous test of this proposal, right- and left-handers were found to associate positive ideas like intelligence, attractiveness, and honesty with their dominant side and negative ideas with their non-dominant side. The goal of the present study was to determine whether 'body-specific' associations of space and valence can be observed beyond the laboratory in spontaneous behavior, and whether these implicit associations have visible consequences. METHODOLOGY AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS:We analyzed speech and gesture (3012 spoken clauses, 1747 gestures) from the final debates of the 2004 and 2008 US presidential elections, which involved two right-handers (Kerry, Bush) and two left-handers (Obama, McCain). Blind, independent coding of speech and gesture allowed objective hypothesis testing. Right- and left-handed candidates showed contrasting associations between gesture and speech. In both of the left-handed candidates, left-hand gestures were associated more strongly with positive-valence clauses and right-hand gestures with negative-valence clauses; the opposite pattern was found in both right-handed candidates. CONCLUSIONS:Speakers associate positive messages more strongly with dominant hand gestures and negative messages with non-dominant hand gestures, revealing a hidden link between action and emotion. This pattern cannot be explained by conventions in language or culture, which associate 'good' with 'right' but not with 'left'; rather, results support and extend the body-specificity hypothesis. Furthermore, results suggest that the hand speakers use to gesture may have unexpected (and probably unintended) communicative value, providing the listener with a subtle index of how the speaker feels about the content of the co-occurring speech.",

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND:Human Immunodeficiency Virus-Infected (HIV+) persons have elevated risks for various manifestations of cardiovascular disease (CVD). No studies to our knowledge have compared atrial fibrillation (AF) and atrial flutter (AFL) prevalence and associated characteristics for HIV+ persons and matched uninfected controls. METHODS AND FINDINGS:Persons with diagnoses of HIV receiving care at a large urban academic medical center were frequency-matched 1:2 on age, sex, race, zip code, and clinic location with uninfected persons. Possible AF\/AFL was screened for using administrative codes and diagnoses of AF\/AFL were subsequently adjudicated using electrocardiography and physician notes; adjudication was performed given the inconsistent validity of administrative code-derived AF diagnoses found in previous studies. There were 101 confirmed AF\/AFL cases (2.00%) among 5,052 HIV+ patients and 159 confirmed AF\/AFL cases (1.57%) among 10,121 uninfected controls [Odds Ratio (OR) 1.27, 95% Confidence Interval (CI) 0.99-1.64; p = 0.056]. The association between HIV serostatus and AF\/AFL was attenuated after adjustment for demographics and CVD risk factors. Among HIV+ persons, nadir CD4+ T cell count <200 cells\/mm3 was associated with approximately twofold elevated odds of AF\/AFL even after adjustment for demographics and CVD risk factors (Multivariable-adjusted OR 1.98, 95% CI 1.21-3.25). There was no significant association between log10 of peak HIV viral load and AF\/AFL (Multivariable-adjusted OR 1.03, 95% CI 0.86-1.24). Older age, diabetes, hypertension, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease were associated with similarly elevated odds of AF\/AFL for HIV+ persons and uninfected controls. CONCLUSION:HIV-related immunosuppression (nadir CD4 T cell count <200 cells\/mm3) and traditional CVD risk factors are associated with significantly elevated odds of AF\/AFL among HIV+ persons. Although atrial fibrillation and flutter was more common among HIV+ versus uninfected persons in this cohort, this difference was attenuated by adjustment for demographics and CVD risk factors.",

            "abstract": "Delay Tolerant Network (DTN) multi-copy routing protocols are privileged to create and transmit multiple copies of each message that causes congestion and some messages are dropped. This process is known as reactive drop because messages were dropped re-actively to overcome buffer overflows. The existing reactive buffer management policies apply a single metric to drop source, relay and destine messages. Hereby, selection to drop a message is dubious because each message as source, relay or destine may have consumed dissimilar magnitude of network resources. Similarly, DTN has included time to live (ttl) parameter which defines lifetime of message. Hence, when ttl expires then message is automatically destroyed from relay nodes. However, time-to-live (ttl) is not applicable on messages reached at their destinations. Moreover, nodes keep replicating messages till ttl expires even-though large number of messages has already been dispersed. In this paper, we have proposed Priority Queue Based Reactive Buffer Management Policy (PQB-R) for DTN under City Based Environments. The PQB-R classifies buffered messages into source, relay and destine queues. Moreover, separate drop metric has been applied on individual queue. The experiment results prove that proposed PQB-R has reduced number of messages transmissions, message drop and increases delivery ratio.",

            "abstract": "Infection and sepsis are leading causes of death worldwide but the epidemiology and outcomes are not well understood in resource-limited settings. We conducted a four-year prospective observational study from March 2013 to February 2017 to examine the clinical epidemiology and outcomes of adults admitted with community-acquired infection in a resource-limited tertiary-care hospital in Ubon Ratchathani province, Northeast Thailand. Hospitalized patients with infection and accompanying systemic manifestations of infection within 24 hours of admission were enrolled. Subjects were classified as having sepsis if they had a modified sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score \u22652 at enrollment. This study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02217592. A total of 4,989 patients were analyzed. Of the cohort, 2,659 (53%) were male and the median age was 57 years (range 18-101). Of these, 1,173 (24%) patients presented primarily to the study hospital, 3,524 (71%) were transferred from 25 district hospitals or 8 smaller hospitals in the province, and 292 (6%) were transferred from one of 30 hospitals in other provinces. Three thousand seven hundred and sixteen (74%) patients were classified as having sepsis. Patients with sepsis had an older age distribution and a greater prevalence of comorbidities compared to patients without sepsis. Twenty eight-day mortality was 21% (765\/3,716) in sepsis and 4% (54\/1,273) in non-sepsis patients (p<0.001). After adjusting for gender, age, and comorbidities, sepsis on admission (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 3.30; 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.48-4.41, p<0.001), blood culture positive for pathogenic organisms (adjusted HR 2.21; 95% CI 1.89-2.58, p<0.001) and transfer from other hospitals (adjusted HR 2.18; 95% CI 1.69-2.81, p<0.001) were independently associated with mortality. In conclusion, mortality of community-acquired sepsis in Northeast Thailand is considerable and transferred patients with infection are at increased risk of death. To reduce mortality of sepsis in this and other resource-limited setting, facilitating rapid detection of sepsis in all levels of healthcare facilities, establishing guidelines for transfer of sepsis patients, and initiating sepsis care prior to and during transfer may be beneficial.",

            "abstract": "Maturation and germination of somatic embryos are two crucial steps in the somatic embryogenesis process. Herein, we evaluated the effects of several factors on the maturation and germination of date palm somatic embryos. Globular somatic embryos of cv. \u2018Najda\u2019 were cultured on Murashige and Skoog medium at full strength (MS), half strength (1\/2MS), and one-third strength (1\/3MS), with or without agar, and supplemented with various concentrations of mannitol, sorbitol, polyethylene glycol (PEG, MW 8000) and abscisic acid (ABA). Our results showed that culture medium strength and texture (liquid or semi-solid), osmotic agents, and the concentration and time of exposure to ABA influence somatic embryo maturation. The highest mean number of mature somatic embryos (106.4 per 100 mg fresh weight callus) was obtained after 3 weeks of culture on full-strength liquid MS medium supplemented with 30 g L-1 PEG and 40 \u00b5M ABA, followed by 9 weeks of culture on the same medium but without ABA. Somatic embryo germination was achieved by transferring mature embryos to MS medium containing various combinations of 1-naphthalene acetic acid (NAA), 6-benzylaminopurine (BAP) and gibberellic acid (GA3). The highest germination rate (68%) of somatic embryos occurred in the presence of 0.5 mg L-1 NAA. However, there was no significant difference with the other germination media (54-66%). Plantlet acclimatization was successfully accomplished, and the survival rate was 80% after 6 months in the glasshouse. The findings of the present study open new prospects for massive propagation of this bayoud-resistant date palm cultivar.",

Root and associated soil samples of each cassava variety were collected from Salem and Kolli Hills of the Eastern Ghats in south India. In addition, we also investigated the relationship between the extent of colonization of AM, DSE fungal and AM fungal spore communities and soil characteristics for each cassava variety. Roots of all the cassava varieties were colonized by AM fungi and 12 varieties had co-colonization of DSE fungi. The AM morphology in all the cassava varieties was of an intermediate type with intercellular and intracellular linear hyphae and arbusculate coils. In addition, we found high AM colonization rates (73-89%) but only moderate rates by DSE (22-68%) fungi. We also found 17 AM fungal spore morphotypes and their abundance varied significantly among cassava varieties. In addition, different physicochemical properties of soils may possibly increase AMF diversity, while different varieties of cassava are commonly associated with differing levels of AM and DSE fungi colonization with soil factors potentially influencing the symbiosis.",

            "abstract": "Pidotimod is a synthetic dipeptide with immunomodulatory activity, but the capacity of pidotimod as an immunologic adjuvant to improve vaccine immunogenicity remains unclear. This study evaluated the effectiveness of pidotimod on immune responses of chickens to Newcastle disease (ND) vaccine, and its efficiency to improve protection against highly virulent ND virus (NDV). A total of 300 one-day-old broilers were divided into five groups (numbered I to V). Group I were unvaccinated and served as blank control group. Chickens in Group II to V were immunised with ND vaccine and supplemented with 0, 0.5, 1, 2\u2009g\/L of pidotimod in drinking water. The results showed that treatment with pidotimod (1\u2009g\/L) remarkably improved (p\u2009<\u2009.05) the potency of ND vaccine in chickens, as demonstrated by increased immune organ index (organ weight\/body weight) and elevated antibody production. Meanwhile, no adverse effect on growth performance was observed. Moreover, as an adjuvant to ND vaccine, pidotimod (1\u2009g\/L) also dramatically promoted (p\u2009<\u2009.05) cell-mediated immunity, as characterised by increased lymphocytes proliferation and elevated ratio of CD4+ to CD8+\u2009cells following NDV stimulation. Furthermore, administration of pidotimod (1\u2009g\/L) was efficient in inducing effective protection against lethal NDV challenge. Collectively, these data indicate that pidotimod may have the potential to be used as an effective vaccine adjuvant and the immunopotentiating effects deserve further study.",

            "abstract": "There are limited studies on the effects of transportation stress and stocking density under tropical conditions and their interactions with aging and muscle types on carcass and meat quality characteristics of goat. The present study investigated the effects of transportation and stocking density on carcass characteristics and meat quality traits of Longissimus dorsi, and Semimembranosus muscles in Boer goats. Thirty 1-year-old Boer goats, divided into two groups, were transported by road for 3.5\u2009h, with density of 0.4\u2009m2 and 0.2\u2009m2 per animal, respectively; a third group which was not transported served as control. Meat pH, drip loss, cooking loss, tenderness and colour were measured from samples of the muscles. The transported goats had significantly lower carcass shrinkage, glycogen content, drip loss, tenderness, lightness, yellowness, hue-angle and chroma values compared to the non-transported group. In contrast, they showed significantly higher cooking loss and redness than the non-transported goats. Goats transported in high stocking density showed significantly (p\u2009<\u2009.05) higher live weight loss and lower dressing-out percentage than those in low stocking density. This study indicated that higher stocking density at pre-slaughter transportation increased shrinkage loss and deteriorated meat quality of goats. Therefore, using an appropriate density during transportation should be considered.",

Our source of patients was the afflicted patients. The sample size and the statistical society of research were determined based on census. The research materials included of two types first included the demographic information of patients (age, gender, tumor type, level of education, residency, smoking and lipid profile) and the second part was some information about the pancreatic cancer (anatomical site, pathologic findings and lipid profile).using SPSS version 19, the data was analyzed.\n\nResults: the statistical society included 25 individuals afflicted with pancreatic cancer in which the most prevalent age group was men older than 70 years (60 years) (31.3%). Furthermore, as time went on, the number of new cases increased.\n\nConclusion: the risk factors for occurring the cancer were the age group greater than 70 years, being male, lower educational situation, unemployment, living in an urban areas, smoking, hereditary, hyperlipidemia (LDL, TG, CHOL) and finding tumor in middle third of pancreatic (because of existing helicobacter pylori virus and impropriate diet). Being able to identify endangered people, one could begin treating patients and thereby, saving time, cost and increasing the rate of survivors.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nKey words: pancreatic cancer, retrospective, epidemiology",

A population-based, cross-sectional study was carried out with 843 children of aged three to five years enrolled at public and private preschools in the city of Campina Grande, Brazil. A questionnaire addressing socio-demographic data and oral health care was self-administered by parents\/caregivers. Three dentists previously calibrated examined the children for the diagnosis of dental caries and lesion activity using the International Caries Detection and Assessment System (ICDAS). Nutritional status was evaluated based on the body mass index. Logistic regression analysis for complex samples was performed (\u03b1 = 5%). The prevalence of dental caries was 66.3%. Among the children with caries, 88.0% had active lesions. Dental caries was more prevalent in girls (OR = 1.53, 95%CI: 1.05-2.23), in children from families with a monthly household income \u2264US$312.50 (OR = 2.38, 95%CI: 1.65-3.43) and those whose mothers had up to eight years of schooling (OR = 1.55, 95%CI: 1.07-2.23). Lesion activity was significantly associated with mother's schooling \u2264 8 years (OR = 2.15, 95%CI: 1.15-4.00). The prevalence rates of dental caries and lesion activity were high and mainly associated with a lower socioeconomic status and mother's schooling.",

METHODS:Flash frozen brain tissue of a series of 20 pathologically confirmed MSA patients [9 olivopontocerebellar atrophy (OPCA) type, 6 striatonigral degeneration (SND) type, and 5 mixed type] was used for this study. Elderly controls (n = 37) as well as idiopathic Parkinson's disease (n = 7), dementia with Lewy bodies (n = 20), corticobasal degeneration (n = 15) and cerebellar ataxia (n = 18) patients were used as comparison groups. CoQ10 was measured in cerebellar and frontal cortex tissue by high performance liquid chromatography. RESULTS:We detected a statistically significant decrease (by 3-5%) in the level of CoQ10 in the cerebellum of MSA cases (P = 0.001), specifically in OPCA (P = 0.001) and mixed cases (P = 0.005), when compared to controls as well as to other neurodegenerative diseases [dementia with Lewy bodies (P<0.001), idiopathic Parkinson's disease (P<0.001), corticobasal degeneration (P<0.001), and cerebellar ataxia (P = 0.001)]. CONCLUSION:Our results suggest that a perturbation in the CoQ10 biosynthetic pathway is associated with the pathogenesis of MSA but the mechanism behind this finding remains to be elucidated.",

The tropical ocean environment, which plays an important role in shaping marine biodiversity, has drastically and frequently changed since the Pliocene. Nevertheless, the evolutionary history of tropical pelagic plankton has been poorly understood, as phylogeographic investigations are still in the developing state and paleontological approaches are insufficient to obtain a sequential record from the deep-sea sediments. The planktonic foraminifer Pulleniatina obliquiloculata is widely distributed in the tropical area throughout the world's oceans, and its phylogeography is well established. It is thus one of the best candidates to examine how past environmental changes may have shifted the spatial distribution and affected the diversification of tropical pelagic plankton. Such an examination requires the divergence history of the planktonic foraminifers, yet the gene marker (partial small subunit (SSU) rDNA) previously used for phylogeographic studies was not powerful enough to achieve a high accuracy in estimating the divergence times. The present study focuses on improving the precision of divergence time estimates for the splits between sibling species (genetic types) of planktonic foraminifers by increasing the number of genes as well as the number of nucleotide bases used for molecular clock estimates. We have amplified the entire coding regions of two ribosomal RNA genes (SSU rDNA and large subunit (LSU) rDNA) of three genetic types of P. obliquiloculata and two closely related species for the first time and applied them to the Bayesian relaxed clock method. The comparison of the credible intervals of the four datasets consisting either of sequences of the partial SSU rDNA, the complete SSU rDNA, LSU rDNA, or a combination of both genes (SSU+LSU) clearly demonstrated that the two-gene dataset improved the accuracy of divergence time estimates. The P. obliquiloculata lineage diverged twice, first at the end of the Pliocene (3.1 Ma) and again in the middle Pleistocene (1.4 Ma). Both timings coincided with the environmental changes, which indirectly involved geographic separation of populations. The habitat of P. obliquiloculata was expanded toward the higher latitudinal zones during the stable warm periods and subsequently placed on the steep environmental gradients following the global cooling. Different environmental conditions in the stable warm tropics and unstable higher latitudes may have triggered ecological divergence among the populations, leading to adaptive differentiation and eventually speciation. A comprehensive analysis of divergence time estimates combined with phylogeography enabled us to reveal the evolutionary history of the pelagic plankton and to find the potential paleoenvironmental events, which could have changed their biogeography and ecology.",

            "abstract": "Many factors influence the physiological stress response to fisheries capture in elasmobranchs. However, the influence of sea surface temperatures (SST) and behaviour are unknown and crucial considering global fishing pressures. We investigated the effect of SST and behaviour on the physiological stress response to capture of the gummy shark, Mustelus antarcticus, and compared our results to a laboratory study using similar conditions to test whether stress responses of in situ capture are consistent with those from laboratory simulations. Capture time for 23 M. antarcticus ranged 32-241 min as measured by hook timers or time depth recorders (TDR) in SSTs ranging 12-20\u00b0C. TDR data from 13 M. antarcticus were analysed to quantify capture behaviour as the percentage of time spent moving during capture. Several physiological variables measured from blood samples obtained immediately upon the animals' landing indicated that although warmer SSTs increased metabolic rate, the stress response to capture was not exacerbated by capture duration. During capture movement occurred for an average of 10% of the time and since M. antarcticus can respire whilst stationary, restricted movement probably mitigated potential influences of increased SSTs and capture duration on the stress response. Previous laboratory findings were also shown to be indicative of in situ conditions and we thus advise that studies control for water temperature given the influence it has on variables (e.g. lactate) used to measure capture stress in elasmobranchs. We highlight the importance of seasonal water temperatures and capture behaviour when assessing the resilience to fisheries capture and the implementation of appropriate fisheries management strategies.",

            "abstract": "Enterovirus 71 (EV71) is the most important etiological agent of hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) in young children, which is associated with severe neurological complications and has caused significant mortalities in recent HFMD outbreaks in Asia. However, there is no effective antiviral therapy against EV71. In this study, RNA interference (RNAi) was used as an antiviral strategy to inhibit EV71 replication. Three small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) targeting the 2Apro region of the EV71 genome were designed and synthesized. All the siRNAs were transfected individually into rhabdomyosarcoma (RD) cells, which were then infected with strain EV71-2006-52-9. The cytopathic effects (CPEs) in the infected RD cells, cell viability, viral titer, and viral RNA and protein expression were examined to evaluate the specific viral inhibition by the siRNAs. The results of cytopathogenicity and MTT tests indicated that the RD cells transfected with the three siRNAs showed slight CPEs and significantly high viability. The 50% tissue culture infective dose (TCID50) values demonstrated that the viral titer of the groups treated with three siRNAs were lower than those of the control groups. qRT-PCR and western blotting revealed that the levels of viral RNA and protein in the RD cells treated with the three siRNAs were lower than those in the controls. When RD cells transfected with siRNAs were also infected with strain EV71-2008-43-16, the expression of the VP1 protein was significantly inhibited. The levels of interferon \u03b1 (IFN-\u03b1) and IFN-\u03b2 did not differ significantly in any group. These results suggest that siRNAs targeting the 2Apro region of the EV71 genome exerted antiviral effects in vitro.",

While there are many tools at a physician's disposal to monitor patients in a hospital setting, the reality is that none of these tools allow hi-fidelity assessment or continuous monitoring towards early detection of hemodynamic instability. We present an advanced automated analytical system which would act as a continuous monitoring and early warning mechanism that can indicate pending decompensation before traditional metrics can identify any clinical abnormality. This system computes novel features or bio-markers from both heart rate variability (HRV) as well as the morphology of the electrocardiogram (ECG). To compare their effectiveness, these features are compared with the standard HRV based bio-markers which are commonly used for hemodynamic assessment. This study utilized a unique database containing ECG waveforms from healthy volunteer subjects who underwent simulated hypovolemia under controlled experimental settings. A support vector machine was utilized to develop a model which predicts the stability or instability of the subjects. Results showed that the proposed novel set of features outperforms the traditional HRV features in predicting hemodynamic instability.",

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND:Palliative sedation is the widely-used intervention of administering sedating agents to induce a state of unconsciousness to take away a dying patient's perception of otherwise irrelievable symptoms. However, it remains questionable whether this ethically complex intervention is beneficial for patients and whether the associated lack of communication in the last phase of life has a negative impact on relatives' wellbeing. METHODS:An observational questionnaire study was conducted among relatives of a consecutive sample of patients who died a non-sudden death in the Erasmus MC Cancer Institute or in the hospice 'Laurens Cadenza' (both in Rotterdam) between 2010 and 2013. RESULTS:Relatives filled in questionnaires regarding 151 patients who had been sedated and 90 patients who had not been sedated. The median time since all patients had passed away was 21 (IQR 14-32) months. No significant differences were found in relatives\u00b4 assessments of the quality of end-of-life care, patients\u00b4 quality of life in the last week before death and their quality of dying, between patients who did and did not receive sedation, or in relatives' satisfaction with their own life, their general health and their mental wellbeing after the patient's death. CONCLUSIONS:The use of sedation in these patients appears to have no negative effect on bereaved relatives' evaluation of the patient's dying phase, or on their own wellbeing after the patient's death.",

This study explores factors associated with high HIV risk behavior in tuberculosis (TB) patients with alcohol use disorders in Tomsk, RF. This analysis was nested within the Integrated Management of Physician-delivered Alcohol Care for TB Patients (IMPACT, trial number NCT00675961) randomized controlled study of integrating alcohol treatment into TB treatment in Tomsk. Demographics, HIV risk behavior (defined as participant report of high-risk intravenous drug use and\/or multiple sexual partners with inconsistent condom use in the last six months), clinical data, alcohol use, depression and psychosocial factors were collected from 196 participants (161 male and 35 female) at baseline. Forty-six participants (23.5%) endorsed HIV risk behavior at baseline. Incarceration history(Odds Ratio (OR)3.93, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.95, 7.95), age under 41 (OR:2.97, CI:1.46, 6.04), drug addiction(OR: 3.60 CI:1.10, 11.77), history of a sexually transmitted disease(STD)(OR 2.00 CI:1.02, 3.90), low social capital (OR:2.81 CI:0.99, 8.03) and heavier alcohol use (OR:2.56 CI: 1.02, 6.46) were significantly more likely to be associated with HIV risk behavior at baseline. In adjusted analysis, age under 41(OR: 4.93, CI: 2.10, 11.58), incarceration history(OR: 3.56 CI:1.55, 8.17) and STD history (OR: 3.48, CI: 1.5, 8.10) continued to be significantly associated with HIV risk behavior. Understanding HIV transmission dynamics in Russia remains an urgent priority to inform strategies to address the epidemic. Larger studies addressing sex differences in risks and barriers to protective behavior are needed.",

            "abstract": "We previously reported that 15-lipoxygenase (15-LO) and its metabolite 15-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (15-HETE) were up-regulated in pulmonary arterial cells from both pulmonary artery hypertension patients and hypoxic rats and that these factors mediated the progression of pulmonary hypertension (PH) by affecting the proliferation and apoptosis of pulmonary arterial (PA) cells. However, the underlying mechanisms of the remodeling induced by 15-HETE have remained unclear. As reactive oxygen species (ROS) and 15-LO are both induced by hypoxia, it is possible that ROS are involved in the events of hypoxia-induced 15-LO expression that lead to PH. We employed immunohistochemistry, tube formation assays, bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation assays, and cell cycle analyses to explore the role of ROS in the process of 15-HETE-mediated hypoxic pulmonary hypertension (HPH). We found that exogenous 15-HETE facilitated the generation of ROS and that this effect was mainly localized to mitochondria. In particular, the mitochondrial electron transport chain and nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase 4 (Nox4) were responsible for the significant 15-HETE-stimulated increase in ROS production. Moreover, ROS induced by 15-HETE stimulated endothelial cell (EC) migration and promoted pulmonary artery smooth muscle cell (PASMC) proliferation under hypoxia via the p38 MAPK pathway. These results indicated that 15-HETE-regulated ROS mediated hypoxia-induced pulmonary vascular remodeling (PVR) via the p38 MAPK pathway.",

            "abstract": "OBJECTIVES:Choosing the right mentor is crucial for effective mentorship. Yet, many medical students have difficulties finding a suitable mentor. Thus we developed mentoring speed dating (MSD) as a promising matching tool to connect students and faculty mentors successfully. The purpose of this study was to explore mentees' and mentors' experience with MSD and investigate the impact of MSD on the perceived mentorship quality and continuance of the mentoring relationship. METHODS:The authors completed a mixed methods study at the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Germany, between June 2011 and March 2014. They conducted four focus groups with mentees and mentors who participated in a mentoring speed dating event and analyzed transcripts using conventional content analysis with inductive categorizing. In addition, three mentoring cohorts (two matched via MSD, one matched via conventional online profiles) were surveyed on mentorship satisfaction and the 1-year continuance of their mentorship was monitored. Fifteen mentees and fifteen mentors participated in the focus groups. The authors identified several themes such as short and long term benefits of MSD and fulfillment of expectations. Benefits included finding out about the personal connection, matching expectations, providing an efficient overview of candidates. The survey was completed by 93 students (n = 29 without MSD; n = 64 with MSD). Independent t-tests and multivariate analysis of variance were used to analyze the impact of MSD on student's mentorship satisfaction. RESULTS:There were significant differences in responses to the items \"Commitment of mentor\" (p = .019) and \"Constructive feedback\" (p = .038) among the students who attended MSD and the students without MSD. After one year far more mentoring relationships existed among those mentees who participated in MSD in comparison to the \"no MSD group\". CONCLUSION:MSD is a valuable matching tool with beneficial effects on the mentorship quality. It enhances essential factors in the mentoring relationship such as commitment and satisfaction.",

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND:Patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) and freezing of gait (FOG) suffer from more impaired motor and cognitive functioning than their non-freezing counterparts. This underlies an even higher need for targeted rehabilitation programs in this group. However, so far it is unclear whether FOG affects the ability for consolidation and generalization of motor learning and thus the efficacy of rehabilitation. OBJECTIVE:To investigate the hallmarks of motor learning in people with FOG compared to those without by comparing the effects of an intensive motor learning program to improve handwriting. METHODS:Thirty five patients with PD, including 19 without and 16 with FOG received six weeks of handwriting training consisting of exercises provided on paper and on a touch-sensitive writing tablet. Writing training was based on single- and dual-task writing and was supported by means of visual target zones. To investigate automatization, generalization and retention of learning, writing performance was assessed before and after training in the presence and absence of cues and dual tasking and after a six-week retention period. Writing amplitude was measured as primary outcome measure and variability of writing and dual-task accuracy as secondary outcomes. RESULTS:Significant learning effects were present on all outcome measures in both groups, both for writing under single- and dual-task conditions. However, the gains in writing amplitude were not retained after a retention period of six weeks without training in the patient group without FOG. Furthermore, patients with FOG were highly dependent on the visual target zones, reflecting reduced generalization of learning in this group. CONCLUSIONS:Although short-term learning effects were present in both groups, generalization and retention of motor learning were specifically impaired in patients with PD and FOG. The results of this study underscore the importance of individualized rehabilitation protocols.",

            "abstract": "The emergence of multidrug-resistant viruses compromises the efficacy of anti-human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) therapy and limits treatment options. Therefore, new targets that can be used to develop novel antiviral agents need to be identified. We previously identified a potential parent compound, hematoxylin, which suppresses the nuclear import of HIV-1 via the Vpr-importin \u03b1 interaction and inhibits HIV-1 replication in a Vpr-dependent manner by blocking nuclear import of the pre-integration complex. However, it was unstable. Here, we synthesized a stable derivative of hematoxylin that bound specifically and stably to Vpr and inhibited HIV-1 replication in macrophages. Furthermore, like hematoxylin, the derivative inhibited nuclear import of Vpr in an in vitro nuclear import assay, but had no effect on Vpr-induced G2\/M phase cell cycle arrest or caspase activity. Interestingly, this derivative bound strongly to amino acid residues 54-74 within the C-terminal \u03b1-helical domain (\u03b1H3) of Vpr. These residues are highly conserved among different HIV strains, indicating that this region is a potential target for drug-resistant HIV-1 infection. Thus, we succeeded in developing a stable hematoxylin derivative that bound directly to Vpr, suggesting that specific inhibitors of the interaction between cells and viral accessory proteins may provide a new strategy for the treatment of HIV-1 infection.",

            "abstract": "The biophysical properties of the basement membrane that surrounds human breast glands are poorly understood, but are thought to be decisive for normal organ function and malignancy. Here, we characterize the breast gland basement membrane with a focus on molecule permeation and mechanical stability, both crucial for organ function. We used well-established and nature-mimicking MCF10A acini as 3D cell model for human breast glands, with ether low- or highly-developed basement membrane scaffolds. Semi-quantitative dextran tracer (3 to 40 kDa) experiments allowed us to investigate the basement membrane scaffold as a molecule diffusion barrier in human breast acini in vitro. We demonstrated that molecule permeation correlated positively with macromolecule size and intriguingly also with basement membrane development state, revealing a pore size of at least 9 nm. Notably, an intact collagen IV mesh proved to be essential for this permeation function. Furthermore, we performed ultra-sensitive atomic force microscopy to quantify the response of native breast acini and of decellularized basement membrane shells against mechanical indentation. We found a clear correlation between increasing acinar force resistance and basement membrane formation stage. Most important native acini with highly-developed basement membranes as well as cell-free basement membrane shells could both withstand physiologically relevant loads (\u2264 20 nN) without loss of structural integrity. In contrast, low-developed basement membranes were significantly softer and more fragile. In conclusion, our study emphasizes the key role of the basement membrane as conductor of acinar molecule influx and mechanical stability of human breast glands, which are fundamental for normal organ function.",

            "abstract": "Early Alzheimer's disease can involve social disinvestment, possibly as a consequence of impairment of nonverbal communication skills. This study explores whether patients with Alzheimer's disease at the mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia stage have impaired recognition of emotions in facial expressions, and describes neuroanatomical correlates of emotion processing impairment. As part of the ongoing PACO study (personality, Alzheimer's disease and behaviour), 39 patients with Alzheimer's disease at the mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia stage and 39 matched controls completed tests involving discrimination of four basic emotions-happiness, fear, anger, and disgust-on photographs of faces. In patients, automatic volumetry of 83 brain regions was performed on structural magnetic resonance images using MAPER (multi-atlas propagation with enhanced registration). From the literature, we identified for each of the four basic emotions one brain region thought to be primarily associated with the function of recognizing that emotion. We hypothesized that the volume of each of these regions would be correlated with subjects' performance in recognizing the associated emotion. Patients showed deficits of basic emotion recognition, and these impairments were correlated with the volumes of the expected regions of interest. Unexpectedly, most of these correlations were negative: better emotional facial recognition was associated with lower brain volume. In particular, recognition of fear was negatively correlated with the volume of amygdala, disgust with pallidum, and happiness with fusiform gyrus. Recognition impairment in mild stages of Alzheimer's disease for a given emotion was thus associated with less visible atrophy of functionally responsible brain structures within the patient group. Possible explanations for this counterintuitive result include neuroinflammation, regional \u03b2-amyloid deposition, or transient overcompensation during early stages of Alzheimer's disease.",

            "abstract": "The thoracic-to-hip circumference ratio (THR) is an anthropometric marker recently described as a predictor of type 2 diabetes. In this study, we performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) followed by confirmatory analyses to identify genetic markers associated with THR. A total of 7,240 Korean subjects (4,988 for the discovery stage and 2,252 for the confirmatory analyses) were recruited for this study, and genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping of the initial 4,988 individuals was performed using Affymetrix Human SNP array 5.0. Linear regression analysis was then performed to adjust for the effects of age, sex, and current diabetes medication status on the THR of the study subjects. In the initial discovery stage, there was a statistically nominal association between minor alleles of SNP markers on chromosomes 4, 8, 10, and 12, and THR changes (p < 5.0 \u00d7 10-6). The subsequent confirmatory analyses of these markers, however, only detected a significant association between two SNPs in the HECTD4 gene and decreased THRs. Notably, this association was detected in male (rs11066280: p = 1.14 \u00d7 10-2; rs2074356: p = 1.10 \u00d7 10-2), but not in female subjects. Meanwhile, the combined results from the two analyses (initial and confirmatory) indicated that minor alleles of these two intronic variants exhibited a significant genome-wide association with decreased THR in the male subjects (n = 3,155; rs11066280: effect size = -0.008624, p = 6.19 \u00d7 10-9; rs2074356: effect size = -0.008762, p = 1.89 \u00d7 10-8). Furthermore, minor alleles of these two SNPs exhibited protective effects on patients' risks for developing type 2 diabetes. In conclusion, we have identified two genetic variations in HECTD4 that are associated with THR, particularly in men.",

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND:MicroRNAs (miR) are small, posttranscriptional regulators, expressed as part of a longer primary transcript, following which they undergo nuclear and cytoplasmic processing by Drosha and Dicer, respectively, to form the functional mature ~20mer that gets incorporated into the silencing complex. Others and we have shown that mature miR-1 levels decrease with pressure-induced cardiac hypertrophy, however, there is little or no change in the primary transcript encompassing miR-1 stem-loop, suggesting critical regulatory step in microRNA processing. The objective of this study was to investigate the underlying mechanisms regulating miR-1 expression in cardiomyocytes. RESULTS:Here we report that GTPase-activating protein (SH3 domain) binding protein 1 (G3bp1), an endoribonuclease regulates miR-1 processing in cardiomyocytes. G3bp1 is upregulated during cardiac hypertrophy and restricts miR-1 processing by binding to its consensus sequence in the pre-miR-1-2 stem-loop. In accordance, exogenous G3bp1 is sufficient to reduce miR-1 levels, along with derepression of miR-1 targets; General transcription factor IIB (Gtf2b), cyclin dependent factor 9 (Cdk9) and eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (Eif4e). While Cdk9 and Gtf2b are essential for transcription, Eif4e is required for translation. Thus, downregulation of miR-1 is necessary for increase in these molecules. Similar to miR-1 knockdown, G3bp1 overexpression is not sufficient for development of cardiac hypertrophy. Conversely, knockdown of G3bp1 in hypertrophying cardiomyocytes inhibited downregulation of miR-1 and upregulation of its targets along with restricted hypertrophy, suggesting that G3bp1 is necessary for development of cardiac hypertrophy. These results indicate that G3bp1-mediated inhibition of miR-1 processing with growth stimulation results in decrease in mature miR-1 and, thereby, an increase of its targets, which play fundamental roles in the development of hypertrophy. CONCLUSION:G3bp1 posttranscriptionally regulates miRNA-1 processing in the heart, and G3bp1 mediated downregulation of mature miRNA-1 levels is required for the derepression of its targets and increase in gene expression during cardiac hypertrophy.",

In this paper, we seek to explore the reasons for abortion denial and whether these reasons had a legal or medical basis. We also identify barriers women faced in accessing abortion and make recommendations for improved access to quality abortion care. We recruited women immediately after they had been turned away from legal abortion services at two facilities in Tunis, Tunisia. Thirteen women consented to participate in qualitative interviews two months after they were turned away from the facility. Women were denied abortion care on the day they were recruited due to three main reasons: gestational age, health conditions, and logistical barriers. Nine women ultimately terminated their pregnancies at another facility, and four women carried to term. None of the women attempted illegal abortion services or self-induction. Further research is needed in order to assess abortion denial from the perspective of providers and medical staff.",

Here, we show the effect of a bacterial polyfructan levan on the growth dynamics and metabolism of fecal microbiota in vitro by using isothermal microcalorimetry. Eleven fecal samples from healthy donors were incubated in phosphate-buffered defined medium with or without levan supplementation and varying presence of amino acids. The generation of heat, changes in pH and microbiota composition, concentrations of produced and consumed metabolites during the growth were determined. The composition of fecal microbiota and profile of metabolites changed in response to substrate (levan and amino acids) availability. The main products of levan metabolism were acetic, lactic, butyric, propionic and succinic acids and carbon dioxide. Associated growth of levan-degrading (e.g. Bacteroides) and butyric acid-producing (e.g. Faecalibacterium) taxa was observed in levan-supplemented media. The study shows that the capacity of levan and possibly also other dietary fibers\/prebiotics to modulate the composition and function of colon microbiota can be predicted by using isothermal microcalorimetry of fecal samples linked to metabolite and consortia analyses.",

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND:The molecular mechanisms driving the papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) are still poorly understood. The most frequent genetic alteration in PTC is the BRAFV600E mutation--its impact may extend even beyond PTC genomic profile and influence the tumor characteristics and even clinical behavior. METHODS:In order to identify BRAF-dependent signature of early carcinogenesis in PTC, a transgenic mouse model with BRAFV600E-induced PTC was developed. Mice thyroid samples were used in microarray analysis and the data were referred to a human thyroid dataset. RESULTS:Most of BRAF(+) mice developed malignant lesions. Nevertheless, 16% of BRAF(+) mice displayed only benign hyperplastic lesions or apparently asymptomatic thyroids. After comparison of non-malignant BRAF(+) thyroids to BRAF(-) ones, we selected 862 significantly deregulated genes. When the mouse BRAF-dependent signature was transposed to the human HG-U133A microarray, we identified 532 genes, potentially indicating the BRAF signature (representing early changes, not related to developed malignant tumor). Comparing BRAF(+) PTCs to healthy human thyroids, PTCs without BRAF and RET alterations and RET(+), RAS(+) PTCs, 18 of these 532 genes displayed significantly deregulated expression in all subgroups. All 18 genes, among them 7 novel and previously not reported, were validated as BRAFV600E-specific in the dataset of independent PTC samples, made available by The Cancer Genome Atlas Project. CONCLUSION:The study identified 7 BRAF-induced genes that are specific for BRAF V600E-driven PTC and not previously reported as related to BRAF mutation or thyroid carcinoma: MMD, ITPR3, AACS, LAD1, PVRL3, ALDH3B1, and RASA1. The full signature of BRAF-related 532 genes may encompass other BRAF-related important transcripts and require further study.",

            "abstract": "For the first time, highly elevated levels of mercury (Hg) have been documented for several species of the edible Fungi genus Boletus growing in latosols, lateritic red earths, and red and yellow earths from the Yunnan province of China. Analysis of Hg concentrations in the genus suggests that geogenic Hg is the dominant source of Hg in the fungi, whereas anthropogenic sources accumulate largely in the organic layer of the forest soil horizon. Among the 21 species studied from 32 locations across Yunnan and 2 places in Sichuan Province, the Hg was found at elevated level in all samples from Yunnan but not in the samples from Sichuan, which is located outside the mercuriferous belt. Particularly abundant in Hg were the caps of fruiting bodies of Boletus aereus (up to 13 mg kg-1 dry matter), Boletus bicolor (up to 5.5 mg kg-1 dry matter), Boletus edulis (up to 22 mg kg-1 dry matter), Boletus luridus (up to 11 mg kg-1 dry matter), Boletus magnificus (up to 13 mg kg-1 dry matter), Boletus obscureumbrinus (up to 9.4 mg kg-1 dry matter), Boletus purpureus (up to 16 mg kg-1 dry matter), Boletus sinicus (up to 6.8 mg kg-1 dry matter), Boletus speciosus (up to 4.9mg kg-1 dry matter), Boletus tomentipes (up to 13 mg kg-1 dry matter), and Boletus umbriniporus (up to 4.9 mg kg-1 dry matter). Soil samples of the 0-10 cm topsoil layer from the widely distributed locations had mercury levels ranging between 0.034 to 3.4 mg kg-1 dry matter. In Yunnan, both the soil parent rock and fruiting bodies of Boletus spp. were enriched in Hg, whereas the same species from Sichuan, located outside the mercuriferous belt, had low Hg concentrations, suggesting that the Hg in the Yunnan samples is mainly from geogenic sources rather than anthropogenic sources. However, the contribution of anthropogenically-derived Hg sequestered within soils of Yunnan has not been quantified, so more future research is required. Our results suggest that high rates of consumption of Boletus spp. from Yunnan can deliver relatively high doses of Hg to consumers, but that rates can differ widely because of large variability in mercury concentrations between species and locations.",

            "abstract": "Current evidence suggests a multifactorial etiology to pelvic organ prolapse (POP), including genetic predisposition. We conducted a genome-wide association study of POP in African American (AA) and Hispanic (HP) women from the Women's Health Initiative Hormone Therapy study. Cases were defined as any POP (grades 1-3) or moderate\/severe POP (grades 2-3), while controls had grade 0 POP. We performed race-specific multiple logistic regression analyses between SNPs imputed to 1000 genomes in relation to POP (grade 0 vs 1-3; grade 0 vs 2-3) adjusting for age at diagnosis, body mass index, parity, and genetic ancestry. There were 1274 controls and 1427 cases of any POP and 317 cases of moderate\/severe POP. Although none of the analyses reached genome-wide significance (p<5x10-8), we noted variants in several loci that met p<10-6. In race-specific analysis of grade 0 vs 2-3, intronic SNPs in the CPE gene (rs28573326, OR:2.14; 95% CI 1.62-2.83; p = 1.0x10-7) were associated with POP in AAs, and SNPs in the gene AL132709.5 (rs1950626, OR:2.96; 95% CI 1.96-4.48, p = 2.6x10-7) were associated with POP in HPs. Inverse variance fixed-effect meta-analysis of the race-specific results showed suggestive signals for SNPs in the DPP6 gene (rs11243354, OR:1.36; p = 4.2x10-7) in the grade 0 vs 1-3 analyses and for SNPs around PGBD5 (rs740494, OR:2.17; p = 8.6x10-7) and SHC3 (rs2209875, OR:0.60; p = 9.3x10-7) in the grade 0 vs 2-3 analyses. While we did not identify genome-wide significant findings, we document several SNPs reaching suggestive statistical significance. Further interrogation of POP in larger minority samples is warranted.",

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND:Increased preparedness for birth and complications is an essential part of antenatal care and has the potential to increase birth with a skilled attendant. We conducted a systematic review of studies to assess the effect of birth preparedness and complication readiness interventions on increasing birth with a skilled attendant. METHODS:PubMed, Embase, CINAHL and grey literature were searched for studies from 2000 to 2012 using a broad range of search terms. Studies were included with diverse designs and intervention strategies that contained an element of birth preparedness and complication readiness. Data extracted included population, setting, study design, outcomes, intervention description, type of intervention strategy and funding sources. Quality of the studies was assessed. The studies varied in BP\/CR interventions, design, use of control groups, data collection methods, and outcome measures. We therefore deemed meta-analysis was not appropriate and conducted a narrative synthesis of the findings. RESULTS:Thirty-three references encompassing 20 different intervention programmes were included, of which one programmatic element was birth preparedness and complication readiness. Implementation strategies were diverse and included facility-, community-, or home-based services. Thirteen studies resulted in an increase in birth with a skilled attendant or facility birth. The majority of authors reported an increase in knowledge on birth preparedness and complication readiness. CONCLUSIONS:Birth Preparedness and Complication Readiness interventions can increase knowledge of preparations for birth and complications; however this does not always correspond to an increase in the use of a skilled attendant at birth.",

            "abstract": "AIM:Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) is associated with gray matter atrophy. Adiposity and physical inactivity are risk factors for T2D and brain atrophy. We studied whether the associations of T2D with total gray matter volume (GMV) and hippocampal volume (HV) are dependent on obesity and physical activity. MATERIALS AND METHODS:In this cross-sectional study, we measured waist-hip ratio (WHR), body mass index (BMI), mean steps\/day and brain volumes in a community dwelling cohort of people with and without T2D. Using multivariable linear regression, we examined whether WHR, BMI and physical activity mediated or modified the association between T2D, GMV and HV. RESULTS:There were 258 participants with (mean age 67 \u00b1 7 years) and 302 without (mean age 72 \u00b1 7 years) T2D. Adjusting for age, sex and intracranial volume, T2D was independently associated with lower total GMV (p = 0.001) and HV (p<0.001), greater WHR (p<0.001) and BMI (p<0.001), and lower mean steps\/day (p = 0.002). After adjusting for covariates, the inclusion of BMI and mean steps\/day did not significantly affect the T2D-GMV association, but WHR attenuated it by 32% while remaining independently associated with lower GMV (p<0.01). The T2D-HV association was minimally changed by the addition of BMI, steps\/day or WHR in the model. No statistical interactions were observed between T2D and measures of obesity and physical activity in explaining brain volumes. CONCLUSIONS:Abdominal obesity or its downstream effects may partially mediate the adverse effect of T2D on brain atrophy. This requires confirmation in longitudinal studies.",

Stroke accuracy and ball velocity of forehand and backhand drives were evaluated in ten young tennis players, immediately before and after having randomly performed two HIIT sessions. One session included MI exercises during the recovery phases, while the other included verbal encouragements for physical efforts and served as control condition. Results revealed that similar cardiac demand was observed during both sessions, while implementing MI maintained groundstroke accuracy. Embedding MI during HIIT enabled the development of physical fitness and the preservation of stroke performance. These findings bring new insight to tennis and conditioning coaches in order to fulfil the benefits of specific playing HIIT sessions, and therefore to optimise the training time.",

The prevalence and consequences of good vs. poor adjustment (resilience vs. vulnerability) following encounters with violence were also examined. Data were based on the sixth wave of the \"Troms\u00f8 Study\" (N = 12,981; 65.7% response rate, 53.4% women, M-age = 57.5 years, SD-age = 12.7 years). Self-reported data on psychological (threats) and physical violence (beaten\/kicked), mental health (anxiety\/depression), musculoskeletal pain (MSP), and granting of disability pension (DP) were collected. Men suffered more violent events during childhood than women did, and vice versa during adulthood. Psychological violence implied poorer mental health and slightly more MSP than physical violence. The risk of MSP was highest for violence occurring during childhood in women and during the last year for men. A dose-response relationship between an increasing number of violent encounters and poorer health was observed. About 58% of individuals reported no negative impact of violence (hence, resilience group), whereas 42% considered themselves as more vulnerable following encounters with violence. Regression analyses indicated comparable mental health but slightly more MSP in the resilience group compared to the unexposed group, whereas the vulnerable group had significantly worse health overall and a higher risk of early granting of DP. Resilience is not an all-or-nothing matter, as physical ailments may characterize individuals adapting well following encounters with violence.",

            "abstract": "Cyclophilins, which bind to immunosuppressant cyclosporin A (CsA), are ubiquitous proteins and constitute a multigene family in higher organisms. Several members of this family are reported to catalyze cis-trans isomerisation of the peptidyl-prolyl bond, which is a rate limiting step in protein folding. The physiological role of these proteins in plants, with few exceptions, is still a matter of speculation. Although Arabidopsis genome is predicted to contain 35 cyclophilin genes, biochemical characterization, imperative for understanding their cellular function(s), has been carried only for few of the members. The present study reports the biochemical characterization of an Arabidopsis cyclophilin, AtCyp19-3, which demonstrated that this protein is enzymatically active and possesses peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase (PPIase) activity that is specifically inhibited by CsA with an inhibition constant (Ki) of 18.75 nM. The PPIase activity of AtCyp19-3 was also sensitive to Cu(2+), which covalently reacts with the sulfhydryl groups, implying redox regulation. Further, using calmodulin (CaM) gel overlay assays it was demonstrated that in vitro interaction of AtCyp19-3 with CaM is Ca(2+)-dependent, and CaM-binding domain is localized to 35-70 amino acid residues in the N-terminus. Bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays showed that AtCyp19-3 interacts with CaM in vivo also, thus, validating the in vitro observations. However, the PPIase activity of the Arabidopsis cyclophilin was not affected by CaM. The implications of these findings are discussed in the context of Ca(2+) signaling and cyclophilin activity in Arabidopsis.",

            "abstract": "Following extensive surgical debridement in the treatment of infection, a \"dead space\" can result following surgical closure that can fill with hematoma, an environment conducive to bacterial growth. The eradication of dead space is essential in order to prevent recurrent infection. This study describes a novel small animal model to investigate dead-space management in muscle tissue. Two absorbable test materials were implanted in each animal; beads of calcium sulfate alone, and beads loaded with vancomycin and tobramycin. In-life blood samples and radiographs were taken from each animal following implantation. Animals were sacrificed at 1, 7, 21, 42, and 63 days post-operatively (n = 4), and implant sites were analysed by micro-computed tomography, histology and immunohistochemistry. Complete resorption was confirmed radiographically at 3 weeks post-implantation. Histologically, the host tissue response to both materials was identical, and subsequent healing at the implant sites was observed with no dead space remaining. Vancomycin was not detected in blood serum. However, peak tobramycin levels were detected in all animals at 6 hours post-implantation with no detectable levels in any animals at 72 hours post implantation. Serological inflammatory cytokine expression for IL-6, TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 indicated no unusual inflammatory response to the implanted materials or surgical procedure. The model was found to be convenient and effective for the assessment of implant materials for management of dead space in muscle tissue. The two materials tested were effective in resolving the surgically created dead space, and did not elicit any unexpected adverse host response.",

Here, the metabolic response of both tomato and Arabidopsis thaliana to V. dahliae infection was analysed by first using non-targeted GC-MS profiling. The leaf content of both major cell wall components glucuronic acid and xylose was reduced in the presence of the pathogen in tomato but enhanced in A. thaliana. The leaf content of the two tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates fumaric acid and succinic acid was increased in the leaf of both species, reflecting a likely higher demand for reducing equivalents required for defence responses. A prominent group of affected compounds was amino acids and based on the targeted analysis in the root, it was shown that the level of 12 and four free amino acids was enhanced by the infection in, respectively, tomato and A. thaliana, with leucine and histidine being represented in both host species. The leaf content of six free amino acids was reduced in the leaf tissue of diseased A. thaliana plants, while that of two free amino acids was raised in the tomato plants. This study emphasizes the role of primary plant metabolites in adaptive responses when the fungus has colonized the plant.",

The evolution of the gene that encodes the transposase responsible for mobilizing PIF-like elements has been studied in both plants and animals, but the elements' history in flowering plants remains poorly known. In this work, we describe the phylogenetic distribution and evolution of PIF-like elements in the genomes of 21 diploid species from the wheat tribe, Triticeae, and we present the first convincing evidence of horizontal transfer of PIF elements in plant genomes. A phylogenetic analysis of 240 PIF sequences based on the conserved region of the transposase domain revealed at least four main transposase lineages. Their complex evolutionary history can be best explained by a combination of vertical transmission with differential evolutionary success among lineages, and occasional horizontal transfer between phylogenetically distant Triticeae genera. In addition, we identified 127 potentially functional transposase sequences indicating possible recent activity of PIF.",

            "abstract": "Studies in transgenic murine models have provided insight into the complexity underlying inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), a disease hypothesized to result from an injurious immune response against intestinal microbiota. We recently developed a mouse model of IBD that phenotypically and histologically resembles human childhood-onset ulcerative colitis (UC), using mice that are genetically modified to be deficient in the cytokines TNF and IL-10 (\"T\/I\" mice). Here we report the effects of early life onset of colon inflammation on growth and reproductive performance of T\/I mice. T\/I dams with colitis often failed to get pregnant or had small litters with pups that failed to thrive. Production was optimized by breeding double homozygous mutant T\/I males to females homozygous mutant for TNF deficiency and heterozygous for deficiency of IL-10 (\"T\/I-het\" dams) that were not susceptible to spontaneous colon inflammation. When born to healthy (T\/I-het) dams, T\/I pups initially gained weight similarly to wild type (WT) pups and to their non-colitis-susceptible T\/I-het littermates. However, their growth curves diverged between 8 and 13 weeks, when most T\/I mice had developed moderate to severe colitis. The observed growth failure in T\/I mice occurred despite a significant increase in their food consumption and in the absence of protein loss in the stool. This was not due to TNF-induced anorexia or altered food consumption due to elevated leptin levels. Metabolic studies demonstrated increased consumption of oxygen and water and increased production of heat and CO2 in T\/I mice compared to their T\/I-het littermates, without differences in motor activity. Based on the clinical similarities of this early life onset model of IBD in T\/I mice to human IBD, these results suggest that mechanisms previously hypothesized to explain growth failure in children with IBD require re-evaluation. The T\/I mouse model may be useful for further investigation of such mechanisms and for development of therapies to prevent reproductive complications and\/or growth failure in humans with IBD.",

            "abstract": "INTRODUCTION:Smartphone applications (apps) facilitate the collection of data on multiple aspects of behavior that are useful for characterizing baseline patterns and for monitoring progress in interventions aimed at promoting healthier lifestyles. Individual-based models can be used to examine whether behavior, such as diet, corresponds to certain typological patterns. The objectives of this paper are to demonstrate individual-based modeling methods relevant to a person's eating behavior, and the value of such approach compared to typical regression models. METHOD:Using a mobile app, 2 weeks of physical activity and ecological momentary assessment (EMA) data, and 6 days of diet data were collected from 12 university students recruited from a university in Kunming, a rapidly developing city in southwest China. Phone GPS data were collected for the entire 2-week period, from which exposure to various food environments along each subject's activity space was determined. Physical activity was measured using phone accelerometry. Mobile phone EMA was used to assess self-reported emotion\/feelings. The portion size of meals and food groups was determined from voice-annotated videos of meals. Individual-based regression models were used to characterize subjects as following one of 4 diet typologies: those with a routine portion sizes determined by time of day, those with portion sizes that balance physical activity (energy balance), those with portion sizes influenced by emotion, and those with portion sizes associated with food environments. RESULTS:Ample compliance with the phone-based behavioral assessment was observed for all participants. Across all individuals, 868 consumed food items were recorded, with fruits, grains and dairy foods dominating the portion sizes. On average, 218 hours of accelerometry and 35 EMA responses were recorded for each participant. For some subjects, the routine model was able to explain up to 47% of the variation in portion sizes, and the energy balance model was able to explain over 88% of the variation in portion sizes. Across all our subjects, the food environment was an important predictor of eating patterns. Generally, grouping all subjects into a pooled model performed worse than modeling each individual separately. CONCLUSION:A typological modeling approach was useful in understanding individual dietary behaviors in our cohort. This approach may be applicable to the study of other human behaviors, particularly those that collect repeated measures on individuals, and those involving smartphone-based behavioral measurement.",

            "abstract": "OBJECTIVE:Food stimuli are omnipresent and naturally primary reinforcing stimuli. One explanation for the intake of high amounts of food in binge eating disorder (BED) is a deviant valuation process. Valuation of food stimuli is supposed to influence approach or avoidance behaviour towards food. Focusing on self-reported and indirect (facial electromyography) valuation process, motivational aspects in the processing of food stimuli were investigated. METHODS:We compared an overweight sample with BED (BED+) with an overweight sample without BED (BED-) and with normal weight controls (NWC) regarding their self-reported and indirect (via facial electromyography) valuation of food versus non-food stimuli. RESULTS:Regarding the self-reported valuation, the BED+ sample showed a significantly stronger food-bias compared to the BED- sample, as food stimuli were rated as significantly more positive than the non-food stimuli in the BED+ sample. This self-reported valuation pattern could not be displayed in the indirect valuation. Food stimuli evoked negative indirect valuation in all groups. The BED+ sample showed the plainest approach-avoidance conflict marked by a diverging self-reported (positive) and indirect (negative) valuation of food stimuli. CONCLUSIONS:BED+ showed a deviant self-reported valuation of food as compared to BED-. The valuation process of the BED+ sample seems to be characterized by a motivational ambivalence. This ambivalence should be subject of further studies and may be of potential use for therapeutic interventions.",

In response to such intense selection pressures, the bovine genome has undergone changes at the underlying regions of functional genetic variants, which are termed \"selection signatures\". This article reviews 64 recent (2009-2015) investigations testing genomic diversity for departure from neutrality in worldwide cattle populations. In particular, we constructed a meta-assembly of 16,158 selection signatures for individual breeds and their archetype groups (European, African, Zebu and composite) from 56 genome-wide scans representing 70,743 animals of 90 pure and crossbred cattle breeds. Meta-selection-scores (MSS) were computed by combining published results at every given locus, within a sliding window span. MSS were adjusted for common samples across studies and were weighted for significance thresholds across and within studies. Published selection signatures show extensive coverage across the bovine genome, however, the meta-assembly provides a consensus profile of 263 genomic regions of which 141 were unique (113 were breed-specific) and 122 were shared across cattle archetypes. The most prominent peaks of MSS represent regions under selection across multiple populations and harboured genes of known major effects (coat color, polledness and muscle hypertrophy) and genes known to influence polygenic traits (stature, adaptation, feed efficiency, immunity, behaviour, reproduction, beef and dairy production). As the first meta-assembly of selection signatures, it offers novel insights about the hotspots of selective sweeps in the bovine genome, and this method could equally be applied to other species.",

            "abstract": "Reactive oxygen species (ROS; superoxide, peroxide, and hydroxyl radical) are thought to contribute to the rapid bactericidal activity of diverse antimicrobial agents. The possibility has been raised that consumption of antioxidants in food may interfere with the lethal action of antimicrobials. Whether nutritional supplements containing antioxidant activity are also likely to interfere with antimicrobial lethality is unknown. To examine this possibility, resveratrol, a popular antioxidant dietary supplement, was added to cultures of Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus that were then treated with antimicrobial and assayed for bacterial survival and the recovery of mutants resistant to an unrelated antimicrobial, rifampicin. Resveratrol, at concentrations likely to be present during human consumption, caused a 2- to 3-fold reduction in killing during a 2-hr treatment with moxifloxacin or kanamycin. At higher, but still subinhibitory concentrations, resveratrol reduced antimicrobial lethality by more than 3 orders of magnitude. Resveratrol also reduced the increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) characteristic of treatment with quinolone (oxolinic acid). These data support the general idea that the lethal activity of some antimicrobials involves ROS. Surprisingly, subinhibitory concentrations of resveratrol promoted (2- to 6-fold) the recovery of rifampicin-resistant mutants arising from the action of ciprofloxacin, kanamycin, or daptomycin. This result is consistent with resveratrol reducing ROS to sublethal levels that are still mutagenic, while the absence of resveratrol allows ROS levels to high enough to kill mutagenized cells. Suppression of antimicrobial lethality and promotion of mutant recovery by resveratrol suggests that the antioxidant may contribute to the emergence of resistance to several antimicrobials, especially if new derivatives and\/or formulations of resveratrol markedly increase bioavailability.",

            "abstract": "Coptis (Ranunculaceae) contains 15 species and is one of the pharmaceutically most important plant genera in eastern Asia. Understanding of the evolution of morphological characters and phylogenetic relationships within the genus is very limited. Here, we present the first comprehensive phylogenetic analysis of the genus based on two plastid and one nuclear markers. The phylogeny was reconstructed using Bayesian inference, as well as maximum parsimony and maximum likelihood methods. The Swofford-Olsen-Waddell-Hillis and Bayesian tests were used to assess the strength of the conflicts between traditional taxonomic units and those suggested by the phylogenetic inferences. Evolution of morphological characters was inferred using Bayesian method to identify synapomorphies for the infrageneric lineages. Our data recognize two strongly supported clades within Coptis. The first clade contains subgenus Coptis and section Japonocoptis of subgenus Metacoptis, supported by morphological characters, such as traits of the central leaflet base, petal color, and petal shape. The second clade consists of section Japonocoptis of subgenus Metacoptis. Coptis morii is not united with C. quinquefolia, in contrast with the view that C. morii is a synonym of C. quinquefolia. Two varieties of C. chinensis do not cluster together. Coptis groenlandica and C. lutescens are reduced to C. trifolia and C. japonica, respectively. Central leaflet base, sepal shape, and petal blade carry a strong phylogenetic signal in Coptis, while leaf type, sepal and petal color, and petal shape exhibit relatively higher levels of evolutionary flexibility.",

            "abstract": "OBJECTIVE:To assess variations in adherence to guidelines for management of postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) among midwives. METHODS:A multicentre vignette-based study was e-mailed to a random sample of midwives from 145 maternity units in France. They were asked to describe how they would manage the PPH described in 2 case-vignettes. These previously validated case-vignettes described 2 different scenarios for severe PPH. Vignette 1 described a typical immediate, severe PPH and vignette 2 a less typical case of severe but gradual PPH. They were constructed in 3 successive steps and included multiple-choice questions proposing several types of clinical practice options at each step. An expert consensus defined 14 criteria for assessing adherence to guidelines issued by the French College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists in 2004 in the midwives' responses. We analyzed the number of errors among the 14 criteria to quantify the level of adherence. RESULTS:We obtained 450 complete responses from midwives from 87 maternity units. The rate of complete adherence (no error for any of the 14 criteria) was low: 25.1% in vignette 1 and 4.2% in vignette 2. The error rate was higher for pharmacological management, especially oxytocin use, than for non-pharmacological management and communication-monitoring-investigation. Adherence to guidelines varied substantially between and within maternity units, as well as between the vignettes for the same midwives. CONCLUSION:Reponses to case-vignettes demonstrated substantial variations in PPH management and especially individual variations in adherence to guidelines. Midwives should participate in continuous and individualized training.",

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND:The Emergency, Triage, Assessment and Treatment plus Admission care (ETAT+) course, a comprehensive advanced pediatric life support course, was introduced in Rwanda in 2010 to facilitate the achievement of the fourth Millennium Development Goal. The impact of the course on improving healthcare workers (HCWs) knowledge and practical skills related to providing emergency care to severely ill newborns and children in Rwanda has not been studied. OBJECTIVE:To evaluate the impact of the ETAT+ course on HCWs knowledge and practical skills, and to identify factors associated with greater improvement in knowledge and skills. METHODS:We used a one group, pre-post test study using data collected during ETAT+ course implementation from 2010 to 2013. The paired t-test was used to assess the effect of ETAT+ course on knowledge improvement in participating HCWs. Mixed effects linear and logistic regression models were fitted to explore factors associated with HCWs performance in ETAT+ course knowledge and practical skills assessments, while accounting for clustering of HCWs in hospitals. RESULTS:374 HCWs were included in the analysis. On average, knowledge scores improved by 22.8\/100 (95% confidence interval (CI) 20.5, 25.1). In adjusted models, bilingual (French & English) participants had a greater improvement in knowledge 7.3 (95% CI 4.3, 10.2) and higher odds of passing the practical skills assessment (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 2.60; 95% CI 1.25, 5.40) than those who were solely proficient in French. Participants who attended a course outside of their health facility had higher odds of passing the skills assessment (aOR = 2.11; 95% CI 1.01, 4.44) than those who attended one within their health facility. CONCLUSIONS:The current study shows a positive impact of ETAT+ course on improving participants' knowledge and skills related to managing emergency pediatric and neonatal care conditions. The findings regarding key factors influencing ETAT+ course outcomes demonstrate the importance of considering key contextual factors (e.g., language barriers) that might affect HCWs performance in this type of continuous medical education.",

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND:Orangutans are critically endangered primarily due to loss and fragmentation of their natural habitat. This could bring them into closer contact with humans and increase the risk of zoonotic pathogen transmission. AIMS:To describe the prevalence and diversity of Cryptosporidium spp., microsporidia and Giardia intestinalis in orangutans at seven sites on Sumatra and Kalimantan, and to evaluate the impact of orangutans' habituation and location on the occurrence of these zoonotic protists. RESULT:The overall prevalence of parasites in 298 examined animals was 11.1%. The most prevalent microsporidia was Encephalitozoon cuniculi genotype II, found in 21 animals (7.0%). Enterocytozoon bieneusi genotype D (n = 5) and novel genotype Pongo 2 were detected only in six individuals (2.0%). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of these parasites in orangutans. Eight animals were positive for Cryptosporidium spp. (2.7%), including C. parvum (n = 2) and C. muris (n = 6). Giardia intestinalis assemblage B, subtype MB6, was identified in a single individual. While no significant differences between the different human contact level groups (p = 0.479-0.670) or between the different islands (p = 0.992) were reported in case of E. bieneusi or E. cuniculi, Cryptosporidium spp. was significantly less frequently detected in wild individuals (p < 2\u00d710-16) and was significantly more prevalent in orangutans on Kalimantan than on Sumatra (p < 2\u00d710-16). CONCLUSION:Our results revealed that wild orangutans are significantly less frequently infected by Cryptosporidium spp. than captive and semi-wild animals. In addition, this parasite was more frequently detected at localities on Kalimantan. In contrast, we did not detect any significant difference in the prevalence of microsporidia between the studied groups of animals. The sources and transmission modes of infections were not determined, as this would require repeated sampling of individuals, examination of water sources, and sampling of humans and animals sharing the habitat with orangutans.",

            "abstract": "Programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) plays an important inhibitory role in anti-tumor responses, so it is considered as a powerful candidate gene for individual's genetic susceptibility to cancer. Recently, some epidemiological studies have evaluated the association between PD-1 polymorphisms and cancer risk. However, the results of the studies are conflicting. Therefore, a meta-analysis was performed. We identified all studies reporting the relationship between PD-1 polymorphisms and cancers by electronically searches. According to the inclusion criteria and the quality assessment of Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS), only high quality studies were included. A total of twelve relevant studies involving 5,206 cases and 5,174 controls were recruited. For PD-1.5 (rs2227981) polymorphism, significantly decreased cancer risks were obtained among overall population, Asians subgroup and population-based subgroup both in TT vs. CC and TT vs. CT+CC genetic models. In addition, a similar result was also found in T vs. C allele for overall population. However, there were no significant associations between either PD-1.9 (rs2227982) or PD-1 rs7421861 polymorphisms and cancer risks in all genetic models and alleles. For PD-1.3 (rs11568821) polymorphism, we found different cancer susceptibilities between GA vs. GG and AA vs. AG+GG genetic models, and no associations between AA vs. GG, AA+AG vs. GG genetic models or A vs. G allele and cancer risks. In general, our results firstly indicated that PD-1.5 (rs2227981) polymorphism is associated a strongly decreased risk of cancers. Additional epidemiological studies are needed to confirm our findings.",

            "abstract": "Drug-induced long-QT syndrome (diLQTS) is often due to drug block of IKr, especially in genetically susceptible patients with subclinical mutations in the IKr-encoding KCHN2. Few variants in the cardiac NaV1.5 Na+ channel complex have been associated with diLQTS. We tested whether a novel SNTA1 (\u03b11-syntrophin) variant (p.E409Q) found in a patient with diLQTS increases late sodium current (INa-L), thereby providing a disease mechanism. Electrophysiological studies were performed in HEK293T cells co-expressing human NaV1.5\/nNOS\/PMCA4b with either wild type (WT) or SNTA1 variants (A390V-previously reported in congenital LQTS; and E409Q); and in adult rat ventricular cardiomyocytes infected with SNTA1 expressing adenoviruses (WT or one of the two SNTA1 variants). In HEK293T cells and in cardiomyocytes, there was no significant difference in the peak INa densities among the SNTA1 WT and variants. However, both variants increased INa-L (% of peak current) in HEK293T cells (0.58 \u00b1 0.10 in WT vs. 0.90 \u00b1 0.11 in A390V, p = 0.048; vs. 0.88 \u00b1 0.07 in E409Q, p = 0.023). In cardiomyocytes, INa-L was significantly increased by E409Q, but not by A390V compared to WT (0.49 \u00b1 0.14 in WT vs.0.94 \u00b1 0.23 in A390V, p = 0.099; vs. 1.12 \u00b1 0.24 in E409Q, p = 0.019). We demonstrated that a novel SNTA1 variant is likely causative for diLQTS by augmenting INa-L. These data suggest that variants within the NaV1.5-interacting \u03b11-syntrophin are a potential mechanism for diLQTS, thereby expanding the concept that variants within congenital LQTS loci can cause diLQTS.",

Disialoganglioside (GD2) is consistently expressed at high-levels in neuroblastoma tumors, which have been targeted with some success using therapeutic monoclonal antibodies. GD2 is also expressed in a range of other cancer but with the exception of some peripheral nerves is largely absent from non-transformed tissues. Chimeric Antigen Receptors (CARs) are artificial type I proteins which graft the specificity of a monoclonal antibody onto a T-cell. Clinical data with early CAR designs directed against GD2 have shown some promise in Neuroblastoma. Here, we describe a GD2-targeting CAR retroviral cassette, which has been optimized for CAR T-cell persistence, efficacy and safety.",

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND:Armolipid Plus (AP) is a nutraceutical that contains policosanol, fermented rice with red yeast, berberine, coenzyme Q10, folic acid, and astaxanthin. It has been shown to be effective in reducing plasma LDL cholesterol (LDLc) levels. In the multicenter randomized trial NCT01562080, there was large interindividual variability in the plasma LDLc response to AP supplementation. We hypothesized that the variability in LDLc response to AP supplementation may be linked to LDLR and PCSK9 polymorphisms. MATERIAL AND METHODS:We sequenced the LDLR 3' and 5' untranslated regions (UTR) and the PCSK9 5' UTR of 102 participants with moderate hypercholesterolemia in trial NCT01562080. In this trial, 50 individuals were treated with AP supplementation and the rest with placebo. RESULTS:Multiple linear regression analysis, using the response of LDLc levels to AP as the dependent variable, revealed that polymorphisms rs2149041 (c.-3383C>G) in the PCSK9 5' UTR and rs14158 (c.*52G>A) in the LDLR 3' UTR explained 14.1% and 6.4%, respectively, of the variability after adjusting for gender, age, and BMI of individuals. Combining polymorphisms rs2149041 and rs14158 explained 20.5% of this variability (p < 0.004). CONCLUSIONS:Three polymorphisms in the 3' UTR region of LDLR, c.*52G>A, c.*504G>A, and c.*773A>G, and two at the 5' UTR region of PCSK9, c.-3383C>G and c.-2063A>G, were associated with response to AP. These results could explain the variability observed in the response to berberine among people with moderate hypercholesterolemia, and they may be useful in identifying patients who could potentially benefit from supplementation with AP.",

            "abstract": "The development of a reliable dose monitoring system in hadron therapy is essential in order to control the treatment plan delivery. Positron Emission Tomography (PET) is the only method used in clinics nowadays for quality assurance. However, the accuracy of this method is limited by the loss of signal due to the biological washout processes. Up to the moment, very few studies measured the washout processes and there is no database of washout data as a function of the tissue and radioisotope. One of the main difficulties is related to the complexity of such measurements, along with the limited time slots available in hadron therapy facilities. Thus, in this work, we proposed an alternative in vivo methodology for the measurement and modeling of the biological washout parameters without any radiative devices. It consists in the implementation of a point-like radioisotope source by direct injection on the tissues of interest and its measurement by means of high-resolution preclinical PET systems. In particular, the washout of 11C carbonate radioisotopes was assessed, considering that 11C is is the most abundant \u03b2+ emitter produced by carbon beams. 11C washout measurements were performed in several tissues of interest (brain, muscle and 9L tumor xenograf) in rodents (Wistar rat). Results show that the methodology presented is sensitive to the washout variations depending on the selected tissue. Finally, a first qualitative correlation between 11C tumor washout properties and tumor metabolism (via 18F-FDG tracer uptake) was found.",

            "abstract": "AIM OF THE STUDY:High-salt consumption has been widely described as a risk factor for cardiovascular, renal and bone functions. In the present study, the extent to which high-salt diet could influence Ti6Al4V implant surface characteristic, its adhesion to rat tibial crest, and could modify muscle cell viability of two surrounding muscles, was investigated in vivo. These parameters have also been assessed following a NMES (neuro-myoelectrostimulation) program similar to that currently used in human care following arthroplasty. RESULTS:After a three-week diet, a harmful effect on titanium implant surface and muscle cell viability was noted. This is probably due to salt corrosive effect on metal and then release of toxic substance around biologic tissue. Moreover, if the use of NMES with high-salt diet induced muscles damages, the latter were higher when implant was added. Unexpectedly, higher implant-to-bone adhesion was found for implanted animals receiving salt supplementation. CONCLUSION:Our in vivo study highlights the potential dangerous effect of high-salt diet in arthroplasty based on titanium prosthesis. This effect appears to be more important when high-salt diet is combined with NMES.",

            "abstract": "Ocean soundscapes convey important sensory information to marine life. Like many mid-to-low latitude coastal areas worldwide, the high-frequency (>1.5 kHz) soundscape of oyster reef habitat within the West Bay Marine Reserve (36\u00b0N, 76\u00b0W) is dominated by the impulsive, short-duration signals generated by snapping shrimp. Between June 2011 and July 2012, a single hydrophone deployed within West Bay was programmed to record 60 or 30 seconds of acoustic data every 15 or 30 minutes. Envelope correlation and amplitude information were then used to count shrimp snaps within these recordings. The observed snap rates vary from 1500-2000 snaps per minute during summer to <100 snaps per minute during winter. Sound pressure levels are positively correlated with snap rate (r = 0.71-0.92) and vary seasonally by ~15 decibels in the 1.5-20 kHz range. Snap rates are positively correlated with water temperatures (r = 0.81-0.93), as well as potentially influenced by climate-driven changes in water quality. Light availability modulates snap rate on diurnal time scales, with most days exhibiting a significant preference for either nighttime or daytime snapping, and many showing additional crepuscular increases. During mid-summer, the number of snaps occurring at night is 5-10% more than predicted by a random model; however, this pattern is reversed between August and April, with an excess of up to 25% more snaps recorded during the day in the mid-winter. Diurnal variability in sound pressure levels is largest in the mid-winter, when the overall rate of snapping is at its lowest, and the percentage difference between daytime and nighttime activity is at its highest. This work highlights our lack of knowledge regarding the ecology and acoustic behavior of one of the most dominant soniforous invertebrate species in coastal systems. It also underscores the necessity of long-duration, high-temporal-resolution sampling in efforts to understand the bioacoustics of animal behaviors and associated changes within the marine soundscape.",

            "abstract": "Diabetic retinopathy is a sight-threatening complication of diabetes, affecting 65% of patients after 10 years of the disease. Diabetic metabolic insult leads to chronic low-grade inflammation, retinal endothelial cell loss and inadequate vascular repair. This is partly due to bone marrow (BM) pathology leading to increased activity of BM-derived pro-inflammatory monocytes and impaired function of BM-derived reparative circulating angiogenic cells (CACs). We propose that diabetes has a significant long-term effect on the nature and proportion of BM-derived cells that circulate in the blood, localize to the retina and home back to their BM niche. Using a streptozotocin mouse model of diabetic retinopathy with GFP BM-transplantation, we have demonstrated that BM-derived circulating pro-inflammatory monocytes are increased in diabetes while reparative CACs are trapped in the BM and spleen, with impaired release into circulation. Diabetes also alters activation of splenocytes and BM-derived dendritic cells in response to LPS stimulation. A majority of the BM-derived GFP cells that migrate to the retina express microglial markers, while others express endothelial, pericyte and M\u00fcller cell markers. Diabetes significantly increases infiltration of BM-derived microglia in an activated state, while reducing infiltration of BM-derived endothelial progenitor cells in the retina. Further, control CACs injected into the vitreous are very efficient at migrating back to their BM niche, whereas diabetic CACs have lost this ability, indicating that the in vivo homing efficiency of diabetic CACs is dramatically decreased. Moreover, diabetes causes a significant reduction in expression of specific integrins regulating CAC migration. Collectively, these findings indicate that BM pathology in diabetes could play a role in both increased pro-inflammatory state and inadequate vascular repair contributing to diabetic retinopathy.",

            "abstract": "Taxonomic names associated with digitized biocollections labels have flooded into repositories such as GBIF, iDigBio and VertNet. The names on these labels are often misspelled, out of date, or present other problems, as they were often captured only once during accessioning of specimens, or have a history of label changes without clear provenance. Before records are reliably usable in research, it is critical that these issues be addressed. However, still missing is an assessment of the scope of the problem, the effort needed to solve it, and a way to improve effectiveness of tools developed to aid the process. We present a carefully human-vetted analysis of 1000 verbatim scientific names taken at random from those published via the data aggregator VertNet, providing the first rigorously reviewed, reference validation data set. In addition to characterizing formatting problems, human vetting focused on detecting misspelling, synonymy, and the incorrect use of Darwin Core. Our results reveal a sobering view of the challenge ahead, as less than 47% of name strings were found to be currently valid. More optimistically, nearly 97% of name combinations could be resolved to a currently valid name, suggesting that computer-aided approaches may provide feasible means to improve digitized content. Finally, we associated names back to biocollections records and fit logistic models to test potential drivers of issues. A set of candidate variables (geographic region, year collected, higher-level clade, and the institutional digitally accessible data volume) and their 2-way interactions all predict the probability of records having taxon name issues, based on model selection approaches. We strongly encourage further experiments to use this reference data set as a means to compare automated or computer-aided taxon name tools for their ability to resolve and improve the existing wealth of legacy data.",

            "abstract": "In 1994, South Africa approved a constitution providing freedom from discrimination based on sexual orientation. Other Southern African countries, including Botswana, Malawi, and Namibia, criminalize same-sex behavior. Men who have sex with men (MSM) have been shown to experience high levels of stigma and discrimination, increasing their vulnerability to negative health and other outcomes. This paper examines the relationship between criminalization of same-sex behavior and experiences of human rights abuses by MSM. It compares the extent to which MSM in peri-urban Cape Town experience human rights abuses with that of MSM in Gaborone, Botswana; Blantyre and Lilongwe, Malawi; and Windhoek, Namibia. In 2008, 737 MSM participated in a cross-sectional study using a structured survey collecting data regarding demographics, human rights, HIV status, and risk behavior. Participants accrued in each site were compared using bivariate and multivariate logistic regression. Encouragingly, the results indicate MSM in Cape Town were more likely to disclose their sexual orientation to family or healthcare workers and less likely to be blackmailed or feel afraid in their communities than MSM in Botswana, Malawi, or Namibia. However, South African MSM were not statistically significantly less likely experience a human rights abuse than their peers in cities in other study countries, showing that while legal protections may reduce experiences of certain abuses, legislative changes alone are insufficient for protecting MSM. A comprehensive approach with interventions at multiple levels in multiple sectors is needed to create the legal and social change necessary to address attitudes, discrimination, and violence affecting MSM.",

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND:During pregnancy, syncytiotrophoblast vesicles contribute to maternal tolerance towards the fetus, but also to pathologies such as pre-eclampsia. The aim of the study was to address whether Plasmodium falciparum and HIV infections in pregnancy affect the secretion, microRNA content and function of trophoblast microparticles. METHODS:Microparticles were isolated and characterized from 122 peripheral plasmas of Mozambican pregnant women, malaria- and\/or HIV-infected and non-infected. Expression of placenta-related microRNAs in microparticles was analysed by qPCR and the effect of circulating microparticles on dendritic cells assessed by phenotype analysis and cytokine\/chemokine measurement. RESULTS:Concentrations of total and trophoblast microparticles detected by flow cytometry were higher in HIV-positive (P = 0.005 and P = 0.030, respectively) compared to non-infected mothers, as well as in women delivering low birthweight newborns (P = 0.032 and P = 0.021, respectively). miR-517c was overexpressed in mothers with placental malaria (P = 0.034), compared to non-infected. Microparticles from HIV-positive induced a higher expression of MHCII (P = 0.021) and lower production of MCP1 (P = 0.008) than microparticles from non-infected women. CONCLUSIONS:In summary, alterations in total and trophoblast microparticles associated with malaria and HIV in pregnant women may have an immunopathogenic role. The potential for placental-derived vesicles and microRNAs as biomarkers of adverse outcomes during pregnancy and malaria infection should be confirmed in future studies.",

            "abstract": "OBJECTIVES:Remote Ischemic postconditioning (RIPoC) is a cardioprotective strategy for alleviating the reperfusion injury. We hypothesized that RIPoC or ischemic postconditioning (IPoC) could protect the engrafted mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in reperfusion myocardium. METHODS:Female Sprague-Dawley rats were subject to 30 minutes of occlusion of left anterior descending (LAD). Ischemia reperfusion (IR) received reperfusion without interruption after ischemia. RIPoC received 3 cycles of 30 seconds reperfusion and re-occlusion on the limb at the onset of reperfusion. IPoC received 3 cycles of 30 seconds reperfusion and re-occlusion on the LAD at the same time. Male MSCs were intramyocardially administered after ischemia. RESULTS:Compared with that in IR group, ischemic myocardium in RIPoC+IPoC group, RIPoC group and IPoC group were found to have higher anti-oxidative stress and mitochondrial function level, lower lipid peroxidation and inflammational injury level, higher level of stromal cell derived factor-1 alpha and vascular endothelium growth factor gene expression at 3 days later. By immunohistochemical examination and quantitative polymerase chain reaction, more engrafted MSCs, better cardiac function and less cardiac fibrosis in RIPoC+IPoC group, RIPoC group and IPoC group were detected at 3 weeks after delivery. There were no significant differences between RIPoC and RIPoC+IPoC group. CONCLUSIONS:Combination therapy using intramyocardial MSCs transplantation with RIPoC enhanced transplantation efficiency and cardiac function, and reduced cardiac fibrosis. These beneficial effects were mainly attributed to hospitable milieu for engrafted cells. IPoC could not render additional effect on MSCs engraftment elicited by RIPoC.",

In this region, precipitation and temperature can affect the distribution of these birds through direct (thermoregulation costs) or indirect effects (primary productivity). Thus, it can be postulated that projected climate changes in the region will affect the extent and suitability of their wintering grounds. We studied pipit and chiffchaff abundance in several hundred localities along a belt crossing Spain and Morocco and assessed the effects of climate and other geographical and habitat predictors on bird distribution. Multivariate analyses reported a positive effect of temperature on the present distribution of the two species, with an additional effect of precipitation on the meadow pipit. These climate variables were used with Maxent to model the occurrence probabilities of species using ring recoveries as presence data. Abundance and occupancy of the two species in the study localities adjusted to the distribution models, with more birds in sectors of high climate suitability. After validation, these models were used to forecast the distribution of climate suitability according to climate projections for 2050-2070 (temperature increase and precipitation reduction). Results show an expansion of climatically suitable sectors into the highlands by the effect of warming on the two species, and a retreat of the meadow pipit from southern sectors related to rain reduction. The predicted patterns show a mean increase in climate suitability for the two species due to the warming of the large highland expanses typical of the western Mediterranean.",

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND:Bronchial thermoplasty (BT) is a recently developed treatment for patients with moderate-to-severe asthma. A few studies have suggested the clinical efficacy of this intervention. However, no study has evaluated the cost-effectiveness of BT compared to other alternative treatments for moderate-to-severe allergic asthma, which currently include omalizumab and standard therapy. OBJECTIVE:To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of standard therapy, BT, and omalizumab for moderate-to-severe allergic asthma in the USA. METHODS:A probabilistic Markov model with weekly cycles was developed to reflect the course of asthma progression over a 5-year time horizon. The study population was adults with moderate-to-severe allergic asthma whose asthma remained uncontrolled despite using high-dose inhaled corticosteroids (ICS, with or without long-acting beta-agonists [LABA]). A perspective of the health-care system was adopted with asthma-related costs as well as quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and exacerbations as the outcomes. RESULTS:For standard therapy, BT, and omalizumab, the discounted 5-year costs and QALYs were $15,400 and 3.08, $28,100 and 3.24, and $117,000 and 3.26, respectively. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of BT versus standard therapy and omalizumab versus BT was $78,700\/QALY and $3.86 million\/QALY, respectively. At the willingness-to-pay (WTP) of $50,000\/QALY and $100,000\/QALY, the probability of BT being cost-effective was 9%, and 67%, respectively. The corresponding expected value of perfect information (EVPI) was $155 and $1,530 per individual at these thresholds. In sensitivity analyses, increasing the costs of BT from $14,900 to $30,000 increased its ICER relative to standard therapy to $178,000\/QALY, and decreased the ICER of omalizumab relative to BT to $3.06 million\/QALY. Reducing the costs of omalizumab by 25% decreased its ICER relative to BT by 29%. CONCLUSIONS:Based on the available evidence, our study suggests that there is more than 60% chance that BT becomes cost-effective relative to omalizumab and standard therapy at the WTP of $100,000\/QALY in patients with moderate-to-severe allergic asthma. However, there is a substantial uncertainty in the underlying evidence, indicating the need for future research towards reducing such uncertainty.",

            "abstract": "OBJECTIVE:To determine factors influencing the utilization and accessibility to bacteriologic-based tuberculosis (TB) diagnosis among sputum smear positive (SS+) retreatment TB patients, and to develop strategies for improving the case detection rate of MDR-TB in rural China. STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING:A cross-sectional study of SS+ TB retreatment patients was conducted in eight counties from three provinces with different implementation period and strategy of MDR-TB program in China. Demographic and socioeconomic parameters were collected by self-reporting questionnaires. Sputum samples were collected and cultured by the laboratory of county-designated TB clinics and delivered to prefectural Centers for Disease Prevention and Control (CDC) labs for DST with 4 first-line anti-TB drugs. RESULTS:Among the 196 SS+ retreatment patients, 61.22% received culture tests during current treatment. Patients from more developed regions (OR = 24.0 and 3.6, 95% CI: 8.6-67.3 and 1.1-11.6), with better socio-economic status (OR = 3. 8, 95% CI: 1.3-10.7), who had multiple previous anti-TB treatments (OR = 5.0, 95% CI: 1.6-15.9), and who failed in the most recent anti-TB treatment (OR = 2.6, 95% CI: 1.0-6.4) were more likely to receive culture tests. The percentage of isolates resistant to any of first-line anti-TB drugs and MDR-TB were 50.0% (95% CI: 39.8%-60.2%) and 30.4% (95% CI: 21.0%-39.8%) respectively. CONCLUSIONS:Retreatment SS+ TB patients, high risk MDR-TB population, had poor utilization of access to bacteriologic-based TB diagnosis, which is far from optimal. The next step of anti-TB strategy should be focused on how to make bacteriological-based diagnosis cheaper, safer and more maneuverable, and how to assure the DST-guided treatment for these high-risk TB patients.",

            "abstract": "AIMS:Most public health agencies and learned societies agree that the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test in asymptomatic men should not be recommended, on account of its potential for harm. Yet PSA is still widely used as a screening test and is not being abandoned. This remains a significant public health issue, and citizens' engagement is needed. This study was designed to produce a deliberation on the PSA screening test by a citizens' jury. METHODS:Fifteen citizens were selected and balanced for sex, age, and education. They received an information booklet and participated in a two-day meeting with experts to reach a deliberation on the question \"Should the National Health Service discourage or recommend PSA as an individual screening test for prostate cancer in men 55-69 years old?\". A facilitator ran the jurors' discussion. RESULTS:All except three of the jurors decided that the National Health Service should discourage the use of PSA as an individual screening test for prostate cancer in 55-69 year-old men. The jury was particularly convinced by the uncertainty of the test outcomes, the utility of the test, and its cost\/benefit ratio. Before the meeting 60% of jurors would have recommended the test to a relative, and all the male jurors would have done so. After the meeting these percentages fell to 15% and 12%. CONCLUSIONS:This experience confirms the feasibility and effectiveness of delegating to a group of citizens the responsibility to decide on public health issues on behalf of the community. Public health authorities should invest in information campaigns aimed at the public and in educational initiatives for physicians. This also provided an opportunity to disseminate information on screening, over-diagnosis, and over-treatment.",

            "abstract": "The secretory acinar cells of the salivary gland are essential for saliva secretion, but are also the cell type preferentially lost following radiation treatment for head and neck cancer. The source of replacement acinar cells is currently a matter of debate. There is evidence for the presence of adult stem cells located within specific ductal regions of the salivary glands, but our laboratory recently demonstrated that differentiated acinar cells are maintained without significant stem cell contribution. To enable further investigation of salivary gland cell lineages and their origins, we generated three cell-specific Cre driver mouse strains. For genetic manipulation in acinar cells, an inducible Cre recombinase (Cre-ER) was targeted to the prolactin-induced protein (Pip) gene locus. Targeting of the Dcpp1 gene, encoding demilune cell and parotid protein, labels intercalated duct cells, a putative site of salivary gland stem cells, and serous demilune cells of the sublingual gland. Duct cell-specific Cre expression was attempted by targeting the inducible Cre to the Tcfcp2l1 gene locus. Using the R26Tomato Red reporter mouse, we demonstrate that these strains direct inducible, cell-specific expression. Genetic tracing of acinar cells using PipGCE supports the recent finding that differentiated acinar cells clonally expand. Moreover, tracing of intercalated duct cells expressing DcppGCE confirms evidence of duct cell proliferation, but further analysis is required to establish that renewal of secretory acinar cells is dependent on stem cells within these ducts.",

            "abstract": "Infection with the white spot syndrome virus (WSSV) induces a metabolic shift in shrimp that resembles the \"Warburg effect\" in mammalian cells. This effect is triggered via activation of the PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway, and it is usually accompanied by the activation of other metabolic pathways that provide energy and direct the flow of carbon and nitrogen. Here we show that unlike the glutamine metabolism (glutaminolysis) seen in most cancer cells to double deaminate glutamine to produce glutamate and the TCA cycle intermediate \u03b1-ketoglutarate (\u03b1-KG), at the WSSV genome replication stage (12 hpi), although glutaminase (GLS) expression was upregulated, only glutamate was taken up by the hemocytes of WSSV-infected shrimp. At the same time, we observed an increase in the activity of the two enzymes that convert glutamate to \u03b1-KG, glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) and aspartate aminotransferase (ASAT). \u03b1-ketoglutarate concentration was also increased. A series of inhibition experiments suggested that the up-regulation of GDH is regulated by mTORC2, and that the PI3K-mTORC1 pathway is not involved. Suppression of GDH and ASAT by dsRNA silencing showed that both of these enzymes are important for WSSV replication. In GDH-silenced shrimp, direct replenishment of \u03b1-KG rescued both ATP production and WSSV replication. From these results, we propose a model of glutamate-driven anaplerosis that fuels the TCA cycle via \u03b1-KG and ultimately supports WSSV replication.",

In a two-stage study design, we demonstrated significant association to developing metastatic disease for rs60745952, that in Ashkenazi discovery and validation cohorts, respectively, showed an odds ratio (OR) = 2.3 (P = 2.73E-06) and OR = 1.89 (P = 8.05E-04) (exceeding validation threshold of 0.0044). Significant association to metastatic colon cancer was further confirmed by a meta-analysis of rs60745952 in these datasets plus an additional Ashkenazi validation cohort (OR = 1.92; 95% CI: 1.28-2.87), and by a permutation test that demonstrated a significantly longer haplotype surrounding rs60745952 in the stage IV samples. rs60745952, located in an intergenic region on chromosome 4q31.1, and not previously associated with cancer, is, thus, a germline genetic marker for susceptibility to developing colon cancer metastases among Ashkenazi Jews.",

Since mitochondrial function and biogenesis are controlled by the nutrient environment of the cell, it is possible that perturbation of conserved, nutrient-sensing pathways may successfully treat mitochondrial disease. We found that restricting glucose or otherwise reducing the activity of the protein kinase A (PKA) pathway can lead to improved proliferation of Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells lacking mtDNA and that the transcriptional response to mtDNA loss is reduced in cells with diminished PKA activity. We have excluded many pathways and proteins from being individually responsible for the benefits provided to cells lacking mtDNA by PKA inhibition, and we found that robust import of mitochondrial polytopic membrane proteins may be required in order for cells without mtDNA to receive the full benefits of PKA reduction. Finally, we have discovered that the transcription of genes involved in arginine biosynthesis and aromatic amino acid catabolism is altered after mtDNA damage. Our results highlight the potential importance of nutrient detection and availability on the outcome of mitochondrial dysfunction.",

Therefore we explored the mechanism of promiscuous binding of small molecules by studying the ligand binding domain, the PAS-B domain of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR). Because of the low sequence identities of PAS domains to be used for homology modeling, structural features of the widely employed HIF-2\u03b1 and a more recent suitable template, CLOCK were compared. These structures were used to build AhR PAS-B homology models. We performed molecular dynamics simulations to characterize dynamic properties of the PAS-B domain and the generated conformational ensembles were employed in in silico docking. In order to understand structural and ligand binding features we compared the stability and dynamics of the promiscuous AhR PAS-B to other PAS domains exhibiting specific interactions or no ligand binding function. Our exhaustive in silico binding studies, in which we dock a wide spectrum of ligand molecules to the conformational ensembles, suggest that ligand specificity and selection may be determined not only by the PAS-B domain itself, but also by other parts of AhR and its protein interacting partners. We propose that ligand binding pocket and access channels leading to the pocket play equally important roles in discrimination of endogenous molecules and xenobiotics.",

To extend this line of research, this study aimed to examine the effects of neuroticism and hopelessness in predicting depression among older Korean immigrants. METHODS:Data for this study came from a survey of 220 first generation Korean immigrants aged 65 years or older in Los Angeles County in 2012. Data were collected by face-to-face interviews with trained social workers using a structured questionnaire translated into Korean. All interviews were conducted in Korean. The neuroticism sub-scale of the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire was used to assess neuroticism (EPQN). Hopelessness was measured by the Beck Hopelessness Scale (BHS). Depression was measured by the 20-item Center of Epidemiological Studies Depression (CES-D) scale. RESULTS:The study found that age (\u03b2 = .26, p< .01), gender (\u03b2 = -.13, p< .01), income (\u03b2 = -.13, p< .01), neuroticism (\u03b2 = .51, p< .01), and hopelessness (\u03b2 = .15, p< .01) were significant predictors of depression. CONCLUSION:The study provides preventive strategies that would help in the development of depression-reduction services or programs for the population, especially for those living with neuroticism and hopelessness.",

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND:The \"gold standard\" for assessing mucosal immunity after vaccination with poliovirus vaccines consists in measuring virus excretion in stool after challenge with oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV). This testing is time and resource intensive, and development of alternative methods is a priority for accelerating polio eradication. We therefore evaluated circulating antibody-secreting cells (ASCs) as a potential means to evaluate mucosal immunity to poliovirus vaccine. METHODS:199 subjects, aged 10 years, and previously immunized repeatedly with OPV, were selected. Subjects were assigned to receive either a booster dose of inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV), bivalent OPV (bOPV), or no vaccine. Using a micro-modified whole blood-based ELISPOT assay designed for field setting, circulating poliovirus type-specific IgA- and IgG-ASCs, including gut homing \u03b14\u03b27+ ASCs, were enumerated on days 0 and 7 after booster immunization. In addition, serum samples collected on days 0, 28 and 56 were tested for neutralizing antibody titers against poliovirus types 1, 2, and 3. Stool specimens were collected on day 28 (day of bOPV challenge), and on days 31, 35 and 42 and processed for poliovirus isolation. RESULTS:An IPV dose elicited blood IgA- and IgG-ASC responses in 84.8 to 94.9% of subjects, respectively. In comparison, a bOPV dose evoked corresponding blood ASC responses in 20.0 to 48.6% of subjects. A significant association was found between IgA- and IgG-ASC responses and serum neutralizing antibody titers for poliovirus type 1, 2, 3 (p<0.001). In the IPV group, \u03b14\u03b27+ ASCs accounted for a substantial proportion of IgA-ASCs and the proportion of subjects with a positive \u03b14\u03b27+ IgA-ASC response to poliovirus types 1, 2 and 3 was 62.7%, 89.8% and 45.8%, respectively. A significant association was observed between virus excretion and \u03b14\u03b27+ IgA- and\/or IgG-ASC responses to poliovirus type 3 among immunized children; however, only a weak association was found for type 1 poliovirus. DISCUSSION:Our results suggest that virus-specific blood ASCs, especially for type 3 poliovirus, can serve as surrogate of mucosal immunity after vaccination. Further studies are needed to evaluate the duration of such memory responses and to assess the programmatic utility of this whole blood-based mucosal ASC testing for the polio eradication program.",

            "abstract": "The Toll-like receptor 4 agonist glucopyranosyl lipid adjuvant formulated in a stable emulsion (GLA-SE) promotes strong TH1 and balanced IgG1\/IgG2 responses to protein vaccine antigens. This enhanced immunity is sufficient to provide protection against many diseases including tuberculosis and leishmaniasis. To better characterize the adjuvant action it is important to understand how the different cytokines and transcription factors contribute to the initiation of immunity. In the present study using T-bet-\/- and IL-12-\/- mice and a blocking anti-IFN\u03b1R1 monoclonal antibody, we define mechanisms of adjuvant activity of GLA-SE. In accordance with previous studies of TLR4 agonist based adjuvants, we found that TH1 induction via GLA-SE was completely dependent upon T-bet, a key transcription factor for IFN\u03b3 production and TH1 differentiation. Consistent with this, deficiency of IL-12, a cytokine canonical to TH1 induction, ablated TH1 induction via GLA-SE. Finally we demonstrate that the innate immune response to GLA-SE, including rapid IFN\u03b3 production by memory CD8+ T cells and NK cells, was contingent on type I interferon, a cytokine group whose association with TH1 induction is contextual, and that they contributed to the adjuvant activity of GLA-SE.",

            "abstract": "Childhood maltreatment has diverse, lifelong impact on morbidity and mortality. The Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ) is one of the most commonly used scales to assess and quantify these experiences and their impact. Curiously, despite very widespread use of the CTQ, scores on its Minimization-Denial (MD) subscale-originally designed to assess a positive response bias-are rarely reported. Hence, little is known about this measure. If response biases are either common or consequential, current practices of ignoring the MD scale deserve revision. Therewith, we designed a study to investigate 3 aspects of minimization, as defined by the CTQ's MD scale: 1) its prevalence; 2) its latent structure; and finally 3) whether minimization moderates the CTQ's discriminative validity in terms of distinguishing between psychiatric patients and community volunteers. Archival, item-level CTQ data from 24 multinational samples were combined for a total of 19,652 participants. Analyses indicated: 1) minimization is common; 2) minimization functions as a continuous construct; and 3) high MD scores attenuate the ability of the CTQ to distinguish between psychiatric patients and community volunteers. Overall, results suggest that a minimizing response bias-as detected by the MD subscale-has a small but significant moderating effect on the CTQ's discriminative validity. Results also may suggest that some prior analyses of maltreatment rates or the effects of early maltreatment that have used the CTQ may have underestimated its incidence and impact. We caution researchers and clinicians about the widespread practice of using the CTQ without the MD or collecting MD data but failing to assess and control for its effects on outcomes or dependent variables.",

            "abstract": "OBJECTIVE:To analyze whether the changes observed in the level and distribution of resources for maternal health and family planning (MHFP) programs from 2003 to 2012 were consistent with the financial goals of the related policies. MATERIALS AND METHODS:A longitudinal descriptive analysis of the Mexican Reproductive Health Subaccounts 2003-2012 was performed by financing scheme and health function. Financing schemes included social security, government schemes, household out-of-pocket (OOP) payments, and private insurance plans. Functions were preventive care, including family planning, antenatal and puerperium health services, normal and cesarean deliveries, and treatment of complications. Changes in the financial imbalance indicators covered by MHFP policy were tracked: (a) public and OOP expenditures as percentages of total MHFP spending; (b) public expenditure per woman of reproductive age (WoRA, 15-49 years) by financing scheme; (c) public expenditure on treating complications as a percentage of preventive care; and (d) public expenditure on WoRA at state level. Statistical analyses of trends and distributions were performed. RESULTS:Public expenditure on government schemes grew by approximately 300%, and the financial imbalance between populations covered by social security and government schemes decreased. The financial burden on households declined, particularly among households without social security. Expenditure on preventive care grew by 16%, narrowing the financing gap between treatment of complications and preventive care. Finally, public expenditure per WoRA for government schemes nearly doubled at the state level, although considerable disparities persist. CONCLUSIONS:Changes in the level and distribution of MHFP funding from 2003 to 2012 were consistent with the relevant policy goals. However, improving efficiency requires further analysis to ascertain the impact of investments on health outcomes. This, in turn, will require better financial data systems as a precondition for improving the monitoring and accountability functions in Mexico.",

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE:Ischemic stroke provokes severe brain damage and remains a predominant disease in industrialized countries. The coagulation factor XII (FXII)-driven contact activation system plays a central, but not yet fully defined pathogenic role in stroke development. Here, we investigated the efficacy of the FXIIa inhibitor rHA-Infestin-4 in a rat model of ischemic stroke using both a prophylactic and a therapeutic approach. METHODS:For prophylactic treatment, animals were treated intravenously with 100 mg\/kg rHA-Infestin-4 or an equal volume of saline 15 min prior to transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) of 90 min. For therapeutic treatment, 100 mg\/kg rHA-Infestin-4, or an equal volume of saline, was administered directly after the start of reperfusion. At 24 h after tMCAO, rats were tested for neurological deficits and blood was drawn for coagulation assays. Finally, brains were removed and analyzed for infarct area and edema formation. RESULTS:Within prophylactic rHA-Infestin-4 treatment, infarct areas and brain edema formation were reduced accompanied by better neurological scores and survival compared to controls. Following therapeutic treatment, neurological outcome and survival were still improved although overall effects were less pronounced compared to prophylaxis. CONCLUSIONS:With regard to the central role of the FXII-driven contact activation system in ischemic stroke, inhibition of FXIIa may represent a new and promising treatment approach to prevent cerebral ischemia\/reperfusion injury.",

Symmetric heteroduplex arises from Holliday junction migration, and we suggest this mechanism explains the high frequency of His+ spores in heteroallelic crosses in which recombination is initiated cis to the his-3 allele further from the initiator, cog+. In contrast, when recombination is initiated cis to the his-3 allele closer to cog+, His+ spores are mainly a result of synthesis-dependent strand annealing, yielding asymmetric heteroduplex. Loss of Msh-2 function increases measures of allelic recombination in both his-3 and the fluorescent marker gene, indicating that mismatches in asymmetric heteroduplex, as in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, tend to be repaired in the direction of restoration. Furthermore, the presence of substantial numbers of conversion octads in crosses lacking Msh-2 function suggests that the disjunction pathway described in S. cerevisiae is also active in Neurospora, adding to evidence for a universal model for meiotic recombination.",

This involves the detection of tephra layers which sometimes are not evident to the naked eye, including the so-called cryptotephras. Tests that are expensive, time-consuming, and\/or destructive are often required. Destructive testing for tephra layers of cores from difficult regions, such as Antarctica, which are useful sources of other kinds of information beyond tephras, is always undesirable. Here we propose hyperspectral imaging of cores, Self-Organizing Map (SOM) clustering of the preprocessed spectral signatures, and spatial analysis of the classified images as a convenient, fast, non-destructive method for tephra detection. We test the method in five sediment cores from three Antarctic lakes, and show its potential for detection of tephras and cryptotephras.",

            "abstract": "IMPORTANCE:Acute ischemic stroke is a leading cause of death and disability worldwide. Several recent clinical trials have shown that endovascular treatment improves clinical outcomes among patients with acute ischemic stroke. OBJECTIVE:To provide an overall and precise estimate of the efficacy of endovascular treatment predominantly using second-generation mechanical thrombectomy devices (stent-retriever devices) compared to medical management on clinical and functional outcomes among patients with acute ischemic stroke. DATA SOURCES:MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Collaboration Central Register of Controlled Clinical Trials, Web of Science, and NIH ClinicalTrials.gov were searched through November 2015. STUDY SELECTION:Searches returned 3,045 articles. After removal of duplicates, two authors independently screened titles and abstracts to assess eligibility of 2,495 potentially relevant publications. From these, 38 full-text publications were more closely assessed. Finally, 5 randomized controlled trials of endovascular treatment with predominant use of retrievable stents were selected. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS:Three authors independently extracted information on participant and trial characteristics and clinical events using a standardized protocol. Random effects models were used to pool endovascular treatment effects across outcomes. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES:The primary outcome was better functional outcome as measured on the modified Rankin Scale at 90 days of follow-up. Secondary outcomes included all-cause mortality and symptomatic intra-cerebral hemorrhage. RESULTS:Five trials representing 1,287 patients were included. Overall, patients randomized to endovascular therapy experienced 2.22 times greater odds of better functional outcome compared to those randomized to medical management (95% CI, 1.66 to 2.98; P < 0.0001). Endovascular therapy was not associated with mortality [OR (95% CI), 0.78 (0.54, 1.12); P = 0.1056] or symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage [OR (95% CI), 1.19 (0.69, 2.05); P = 0.5348]. Meta-regression analysis suggested that shorter times from stroke onset to groin puncture and from stroke onset to reperfusion result in better functional outcomes in ischemic stroke patients (P = 0.0077 and P = 0.0089). There were no significant differences in the beneficial effects of endovascular treatment on functional outcomes across categories of gender, age, stroke severity, ischemic changes on computed tomography, or intravenous tissue plasminogen activator administration. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE:This meta-analysis demonstrated superior functional outcomes in subjects receiving endovascular treatment compared to medical management. Further, this analysis showed that acute ischemic stroke patients may receive enhanced functional benefit from earlier endovascular treatment.",

            "abstract": "Insufficient data exist for accurate estimation of global nutrient supplies. Commonly used global datasets contain key weaknesses: 1) data with global coverage, such as the FAO food balance sheets, lack specific information about many individual foods and no information on micronutrient supplies nor heterogeneity among subnational populations, while 2) household surveys provide a closer approximation of consumption, but are often not nationally representative, do not commonly capture many foods consumed outside of the home, and only provide adequate information for a few select populations. Here, we attempt to improve upon these datasets by constructing a new model--the Global Expanded Nutrient Supply (GENuS) model--to estimate nutrient availabilities for 23 individual nutrients across 225 food categories for thirty-four age-sex groups in nearly all countries. Furthermore, the model provides historical trends in dietary nutritional supplies at the national level using data from 1961-2011. We determine supplies of edible food by expanding the food balance sheet data using FAO production and trade data to increase food supply estimates from 98 to 221 food groups, and then estimate the proportion of major cereals being processed to flours to increase to 225. Next, we estimate intake among twenty-six demographic groups (ages 20+, both sexes) in each country by using data taken from the Global Dietary Database, which uses nationally representative surveys to relate national averages of food consumption to individual age and sex-groups; for children and adolescents where GDD data does not yet exist, average calorie-adjusted amounts are assumed. Finally, we match food supplies with nutrient densities from regional food composition tables to estimate nutrient supplies, running Monte Carlo simulations to find the range of potential nutrient supplies provided by the diet. To validate our new method, we compare the GENuS estimates of nutrient supplies against independent estimates by the USDA for historical US nutrition and find very good agreement for 21 of 23 nutrients, though sodium and dietary fiber will require further improvement.",

Bodyweight, fasting glycemia and systolic blood pressure were monitored. Glucose tolerance was evaluated using an oral glucose tolerance test. Insulinemia was measured concomitantly and enable us to calculate insulin resistance markers (HOMA-IR, Insulin Sensitivity Index for glycemia: ISI-gly). Blood chemistry analyses were performed. RESULTS:After six weeks of fructose supplementation, rats were not overweight but presented increased fasting glycemia, reduced glucose tolerance, and lower insulin sensitivity compared to control group. Systolic blood pressure and heart weight were also increased without any change in renal function (theoretical creatinine clearance). After twelve weeks of fructose supplementation, FF rats had increased bodyweight and presented insulin resistance (higher HOMA-IR, lower ISI-gly). Rats also presented higher heart volume and lower ASAT\/ALAT ratio (presumed liver lesion). Surprisingly, the Total Cholesterol\/Triglycerides ratio was increased only after six weeks of fructose supplementation, predicting a higher LDL presence and thus a higher risk of developing cardiovascular disease. This risk was no longer present after twelve weeks of a fructose enriched diet. CONCLUSION:On young Wistar rats, six weeks of fructose supplementation is sufficient to induce signs of metabolic syndrome. After twelve weeks of fructose enriched diet, rats are insulin resistant. This model enabled us to study longitudinally the early development of type 2 diabetes.",

            "abstract": "Human cystatin C (hCC), a cysteine protease inhibitor, has been proposed as a diagnostic marker because its serum levels correlate with certain cardiovascular and kidney diseases. All current hCC assays are based on ex vivo detection. Here we describe the generation and evaluation of antibodies that allow the repetitive binding and release of hCC and hCC-fusion proteins, a prerequisite for long-term measurement, which is required for compatibility with implantable biochip devices and for the development of innovative antibody-based assays suitable for continuous in vivo and in vitro monitoring. Recombinant hCC and hCC-fusion proteins were produced in Escherichia coli and HEK293T cells and were used to generate antibodies by hybridoma technology. After screening by indirect and sandwich ELISAs, 12 monoclonal hybridoma cell lines producing hCC-specific monoclonal antibodies were identified. To determine their hCC association and dissociation properties, the antibodies were analysed by surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy, revealing three with the desired fast binding and moderate-to-fast release characteristics. The analysis of binding and dissociation in the presence of hCC and hCC-fusion proteins using fluorescence-based replacement assays showed that mAb CyDI-4 was the most suitable for further analysis. The results showed that repetitive replacement on mAb CyDI-4 was possible and that most of the change in signal intensity occurred after 20-30 min. Furthermore, the suitability of mAb CyDI-4 for serum hCC measurement was confirmed by a fluorescence-based replacement assay using serially-diluted reference serum from the Institute for Reference Materials and Measurements (ERM-DA471\/IFCC). Our results suggest that the assay covers the physiological and pathological ranges of hCC.",

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:There has been little published information on risk factors for poor long-term outcome in adult biopsy-proven minimal change disease (MCD). METHODS:Data from sixty-three adult, biopsy-proven primary MCD patients treated at a tertiary university hospital between 2003 and 2013 were analyzed. Baseline clinical and pathologic factors were assessed for the associations with composite outcome of creatinine doubling, end stage renal disease, or all-cause mortality. RESULTS:During a median (interquartile) 5.0 (2.8-5.0) years, the composite outcome occurred in 11.1% (7\/63) of patients. The rate of glomerular immune deposits was 23.8% (15\/63). Patients with glomerular immune deposits showed a significantly lower urine protein creatinine ratio than those without deposits (P = 0.033). The rate of non-responders was significantly higher in patients with glomerular immune deposits than in those without deposits (P = 0.033). In patients with deposits, 26.7% (4\/15) developed the composite outcome, while only 6.3% (3\/48) developed the composite outcome among those without deposits (P = 0.049). In multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression analysis, the presence of glomerular immune deposits was the only factor associated with development of the composite outcome (hazard ratio: 2.310, 95% confidence interval: 1.031-98.579, P = 0.047). CONCLUSION:Glomerular immune deposits were associated with increased risk of a composite outcome in adult MCD patients. The higher rate of non-responders in patients with deposits might be related to the poor outcome. Future study is needed.",

            "abstract": "Nitrous oxide (N2O) is a powerful greenhouse gas and a key catalyst of stratospheric ozone depletion. Yet, little data exist about the sink and source terms of the production and reduction of N2O outside the well-known oxygen minimum zones (OMZ). Here we show the presence of functional marker genes for the reduction of N2O in the last step of the denitrification process (nitrous oxide reductase genes; nosZ) in oxygenated surface waters (180-250 O2 \u03bcmol.kg(-1)) in the south-eastern Indian Ocean. Overall copy numbers indicated that nosZ genes represented a significant proportion of the microbial community, which is unexpected in these oxygenated waters. Our data show strong temperature sensitivity for nosZ genes and reaction rates along a vast latitudinal gradient (32\u00b0S-12\u00b0S). These data suggest a large N2O sink in the warmer Tropical waters of the south-eastern Indian Ocean. Clone sequencing from PCR products revealed that most denitrification genes belonged to Rhodobacteraceae. Our work highlights the need to investigate the feedback and tight linkages between nitrification and denitrification (both sources of N2O, but the latter also a source of bioavailable N losses) in the understudied yet strategic Indian Ocean and other oligotrophic systems.",

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND:Fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) is a recognized technique for the basic, preoperative cytological diagnosis of thyroid nodules. AIM OF THE STUDY:To analyze the accuracy of FNAB in the diagnosis of thyroid cancer in patients with solitary and multiple thyroid nodules and to compare the demographic, clinical and pathological characteristics of patients with thyroid carcinoma in solitary and multiple tumors. MATERIALS AND METHODS:The case records of 2,403 patients with solitary and multiple thyroid tumors treated consecutively between 2008 and 2013 were analyzed retrospectively. We selected 1,645 for further analysis. A solitary thyroid nodule was observed in 493 patients, and multiple nodules were detected in 1,152 patients. Further classification of the patients in these two groups was performed on the basis of the FNAB results, type of surgery performed and histopathology. TC was histopathologically confirmed in 166 patients, and benign disease was found in 1,479. The TC patients were assigned to the study group, and those with benign thyroid disease were placed into the control group. The study group was divided into two subgroups according to the presence of cancer in a single thyroid nodule or in multiple nodules. Malignancy in a solitary thyroid nodule was diagnosed in 98 (59.0%) patients, and cancer in multiple nodules was diagnosed in 68 (41.0%). Comparative analyses of the demographic, clinical and histopathological characteristics were performed for both subgroups. The following statistical analyses were performed: comparative characteristic of subgroups, ROC analysis for study group and subgroup of patients, and multivariable logistic regression analysis for study group. RESULTS:The rate of prediction of TC by FNAB was three times higher in the patients with a solitary thyroid nodule compared with those with multiple thyroid nodules and it was statistically significant (p<0.001). The rate of total thyroid resection and lack of necessity for reoperation were also significantly higher in the TC patients with a solitary nodule. The histopathological results showed that significantly more patients with a solitary nodule had advanced-stage TC (stage III or IV) and tumor progression (pT3 or pT4) (p = 0.002 for both). ROC analysis demonstrated that the overall accuracy of FNAB as a predictor of thyroid cancer presence was high, especially for the subgroup of patients with a solitary thyroid nodule (AUC = 0.958, p<0.0001). Multivariable logistic regression analysis confirmed that a positive FNAB result was the sole predictor of the performance of total resection in the TC study group (p<0.0001), while a negative FNAB result and the presence of a papillary cancer type were independent predictors of the risk of reoperation (p<0.0001 and p = 0.002, respectively). CONCLUSIONS:FNAB often produces false-negative results in patients with multiple malignant thyroid tumors, which results in reoperation in many cases. False-negative FNAB results are rare in patients with a solitary tumor. Because of the low predictive capacity of FNAB for thyroid cancer in patients with multiple thyroid tumors, total thyroid excision should be considered in most cases despite a \"negative\" (no malignant) FNAB result.",

            "abstract": "Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a leading cause of sudden cardiac death that often goes undetected in the general population. HCM is also prevalent in patients with cardio-facio-cutaneous syndrome (CFCS), which is a genetic disorder characterized by aberrant signaling in the RAS\/MAPK signaling cascade. Understanding the mechanisms of HCM development in such RASopathies may lead to novel therapeutic strategies, but relevant experimental models of the human condition are lacking. Therefore, the objective of this study was to develop the first 3D human engineered cardiac tissue (hECT) model of HCM. The hECTs were created using human cardiomyocytes obtained by directed differentiation of induced pluripotent stem cells derived from a patient with CFCS due to an activating BRAF mutation. The mutant myocytes were directly conjugated at a 3:1 ratio with a stromal cell population to create a tissue of defined composition. Compared to healthy patient control hECTs, BRAF-hECTs displayed a hypertrophic phenotype by culture day 6, with significantly increased tissue size, twitch force, and atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) gene expression. Twitch characteristics reflected increased contraction and relaxation rates and shorter twitch duration in BRAF-hECTs, which also had a significantly higher maximum capture rate and lower excitation threshold during electrical pacing, consistent with a more arrhythmogenic substrate. By culture day 11, twitch force was no longer different between BRAF and wild-type hECTs, revealing a temporal aspect of disease modeling with tissue engineering. Principal component analysis identified diastolic force as a key factor that changed from day 6 to day 11, supported by a higher passive stiffness in day 11 BRAF-hECTs. In summary, human engineered cardiac tissues created from BRAF mutant cells recapitulated, for the first time, key aspects of the HCM phenotype, offering a new in vitro model for studying intrinsic mechanisms and screening new therapeutic approaches for this lethal form of heart disease.",

            "abstract": "Sphingolipids have been identified as important signaling compounds in stress responses. However, it is not always clear how different sphingolipid profiles are achieved in a particular stress situation. Here we propose a detailed mass action model, containing 42 dependent variables and 137 reactions, that offers explanations of the roles of variant ceramides species, which differ in the lengths of their fatty acyl chains and their saturation state, in the response to hydroxyurea stress. The simulations demonstrate that the cells manage to achieve hydroxyurea tolerance through a well-coordinated, differential usage of the variant ceramide species. Moreover, the results suggest that key enzymes have different affinities toward saturated and unsaturated fatty acyl chains, which implies that the saturation state affords the cells with an additional mode of regulation that had not been recognized so far. These conclusions from our computational analysis are yet to be validated experimentally.",

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND:Assessment of patient-reported outcomes (PROs) provides valuable information to inform patient-centered care, but may also reveal 'PRO alerts': psychological distress or physical symptoms that may require an immediate response. Ad-hoc management of PRO alerts in clinical trials may result in suboptimal patient care or potentially bias trial results. To gain greater understanding of current practice in PRO alert management we conducted a national survey of personnel involved in clinical trials with a PRO endpoint. METHODS AND FINDINGS:We conducted a national cross-sectional survey of 767 UK-based research nurses, data managers\/coordinators, trial managers and chief\/principal investigators involved in clinical trials using PROs. Respondents were self-selected volunteers from a non-randomised sample of eligible individuals recruited via 55 UK Clinical Research Collaboration Registered Clinical Trials Units and 19 Comprehensive Local Research Networks. Questions centred on the proportion of trial personnel encountering alerts, how staff responded to PRO alerts and whether current guidance was deemed sufficient to support research personnel. We undertook descriptive analyses of the quantitative data and directed thematic analysis of free-text comments. 20% of research nurses did not view completed PRO questionnaires and were not in a position to discover alerts, 39-50% of the remaining respondent group participants reported encountering PRO alerts. Of these, 83% of research nurses and 54% of data managers\/trial coordinators reported taking action to assist the trial participant, but less than half were able to record the intervention in the trial documentation. Research personnel reported current PRO alert guidance\/training was insufficient. CONCLUSIONS:Research personnel are intermittently exposed to PRO alerts. Some intervene to help trial participants, but are not able to record this intervention in the trial documentation, risking co-intervention bias. Other staff do not check PRO information during the trial, meaning alerts may remain undiscovered, or do not respond to alerts if they are inadvertently encountered; both of which may impact on patient safety. Guidance is needed to support PRO alert management that protects the interests of trial participants whilst avoiding potential bias.",

            "title": "The Effects of Intra-Aortic Balloon Pumps on Mortality in Patients Undergoing High-Risk Coronary Revascularization: A Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials of Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting and Stenting Era.",
            "abstract": "BACKGROUND:Intra-aortic balloon pumps (IABP) have generally been used for patients undergoing high-risk mechanical coronary revascularization. However, there is still insufficient evidence to determine whether they can improve outcomes in reperfusion therapy patients, mainly by percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stenting or coronary artery bypass graft (CABG). This study was designed to determine the difference between high-risk mechanical coronary revascularization with and without IABPs on mortality, by performing a meta-analysis on randomized controlled trials of the current era. METHODS:Pubmed and Embase databases were searched from inception to May 2015. Unpublished data were obtained from the investigators. Randomized clinical trials of IABP and non-IABP in high-risk coronary revascularization procedures (PCI or CABG) were included. In the case of PCI procedures, stents should be used in more than 80% of patients. Numbers of events at the short-term and long-term follow-up were extracted. RESULTS:A total of 12 randomized trials enrolling 2155 patients were included. IABPs did not significantly decrease short-term mortality (relative risk (RR) 0.66; 95% CI, 0.42-1.01), or long-term mortality (RR 0.79; 95% CI, 0.47-1.35), with low heterogeneity across the studies. The findings remained stable in patients with acute myocardial infarction with or without cardiogenic shock. But in high-risk CABG patients, IABP was associated with reduced mortality (71 events in 846 patients; RR 0.40; 95%CI 0.25-0.67). CONCLUSION:In patients undergoing high-risk coronary revascularization, IABP did not significantly decrease mortality. But high-risk CABG patients may be benefit from IABP. Rigorous criteria should be applied to the use of IABPs.",

The objective of this study was to examine the effect of thyroid hormone withdrawal followed by thyroid hormone in TSH-suppressive dosages, on energy expenditure and brown adipose tissue activity. SUBJECTS\/METHODS:This study was a longitudinal study in an academic center, with a follow-up period of 6 months. Ten patients with well-differentiated thyroid carcinoma eligible for surgical treatment and subsequent radioactive iodine ablation therapy were studied in a hypothyroid state after thyroidectomy and in a subclinical hyperthyroid state (TSH-suppression according to treatment protocol). Paired two-tailed t-tests and linear regression analyses were used. RESULTS:Basal metabolic rate (BMR) was significantly higher after treatment with synthetic thyroid hormone (levothyroxine) than in the hypothyroid state (BMR 3.8 \u00b1 0.5 kJ\/min versus 4.4 \u00b1 0.6 kJ\/min, P = 0.012), and non-shivering thermogenesis (NST) significantly increased from 15 \u00b1 10% to 25 \u00b1 6% (P = 0.009). Mean BAT activity was significantly higher in the subclinical hyperthyroid state than in the hypothyroid state (BAT standard uptake value (SUVMean) 4.0 \u00b1 2.9 versus 2.4 \u00b1 1.8, P = 0.039). CONCLUSIONS:Our study shows that higher levels of thyroid hormone are associated with a higher level of cold-activated BAT. TRIAL REGISTRATION:ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02499471.",

            "abstract": "Differential habitat use and intraguild competition are both thought to be important drivers of animal population sizes and distributions. Habitat associations for individual species are well-established, and interactions between particular pairs of species have been highlighted in many focal studies. However, community-wide assessments of the relative strengths of these two factors have not been conducted. We built multi-scale habitat occupancy models for five carnivore taxa of New York's Adirondack landscape and assessed the relative performance of these models against ones in which co-occurrences of potentially competing carnivore species were also incorporated. Distribution models based on habitat performed well for all species. Black bear (Ursus americanus) and fisher (Martes pennanti) distribution was similar in that occupancy of both species was negatively associated with paved roads. However, black bears were also associated with larger forest fragments and fishers with smaller forest fragments. No models with habitat features were more supported than the null habitat model for raccoons (Procyon lotor). Martens (Martes americana) were most associated with increased terrain ruggedness and elevation. Weasel (Mustela spp.) occupancy increased with the cover of deciduous forest. For most species dyads habitat-only models were more supported than those models with potential competitors incorporated. The exception to this finding was for the smallest carnivore taxa (marten and weasel) where habitat plus coyote abundance models typically performed better than habitat-only models. Assessing this carnivore community as whole, we conclude that differential habitat use is more important than species interactions in maintaining the distribution and structure of this carnivore guild.",

DESIGN:Prospective cross-sectional study. PARTICIPANTS:78 patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension who had at least 6 months of experience with the use of eye drop medications. METHODS:Participants were video recorded while self-instilling artificial tears sequentially to both eyes. Three masked observers graded these video recordings on three criteria: efficacy (the determination of whether an eye drop was instilled on the ocular surface), safety (assessment of whether the tip of the medication bottle made contact with the ocular surface or eyelids), and efficiency (the number of eye drops expressed from the bottle). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES:After grading the video recordings based on efficacy, safety, and efficiency, kappa statistics were used to estimate inter-rater agreement. RESULTS:The mean kappa level of agreement for efficacy, safety, and efficiency was 0.64 (95% confidence interval (CI), 0.42-0.87), 0.73 (95% CI, 0.58-0.88), and 0.62 (95% CI, 0.42-0.81), respectively.

            "abstract": "This paper proposes a simple model to capture the complexity of multilayer systems where their constituent layers affect, and are affected by, each other. The physical layer is a circuit composed by a power source and resistors in parallel. Every individual agent aims at maximizing its own delivered power by adding, removing or keeping the resistors it has; the delivered power is in turn a non-linear function that depends on the other agents' behavior, its own internal state, its global state perception, the information received from its neighbors via the communication network and a randomized selfishness. We develop an agent-based simulation to analyze the effects of number of agents (system size), communication network topology, communication errors and the minimum power gain that triggers a behavioral change on the system dynamic. Our results show that a wave-like behavior at macro-level (caused by individual changes in the decision layer) can only emerge for a specific system size. The ratio between cooperators and defectors depends on the minimum gain assumed-lower minimal gains lead to less cooperation, and vice-versa. Different communication network topologies imply different levels of power utilization and fairness at the physical layer, and a certain level of error in the communication layer induces more cooperation.",

            "abstract": "Grain appearance quality and milling quality are the main determinants of market value of rice. Breeding for improved grain quality is a major objective of rice breeding worldwide. Identification of genes\/QTL controlling quality traits is the prerequisite for increasing breeding efficiency through marker-assisted selection. Here, we reported a genome-wide association study in indica rice to identify QTL associated with 10 appearance and milling quality related traits, including grain length, grain width, grain length to width ratio, grain thickness, thousand grain weight, degree of endosperm chalkiness, percentage of grains with chalkiness, brown rice rate, milled rice rate and head milled rice rate. A diversity panel consisting of 272 indica accessions collected worldwide was evaluated in four locations including Hangzhou, Jingzhou, Sanya and Shenzhen representing indica rice production environments in China and genotyped using genotyping-by-sequencing and Diversity Arrays Technology based on next-generation sequencing technique called DArTseq\u2122. A wide range of variation was observed for all traits in all environments. A total of 16 different association analysis models were compared to determine the best model for each trait-environment combination. Association mapping based on 18,824 high quality markers yielded 38 QTL for the 10 traits. Five of the detected QTL corresponded to known genes or fine mapped QTL. Among the 33 novel QTL identified, qDEC1.1 (qGLWR1.1), qBRR2.2 (qGL2.1), qTGW2.1 (qGL2.2), qGW11.1 (qMRR11.1) and qGL7.1 affected multiple traits with relatively large effects and\/or were detected in multiple environments. The research provided an insight of the genetic architecture of rice grain quality and important information for mining genes\/QTL with large effects within indica accessions for rice breeding.",

            "abstract": "Individual differences in mind and behavior are believed to reflect the functional variability of the human brain. Due to the lack of a large-scale longitudinal dataset, the full landscape of variability within and between individual functional connectomes is largely unknown. We collected 300 resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rfMRI) datasets from 30 healthy participants who were scanned every three days for one month. With these data, both intra- and inter-individual variability of six common rfMRI metrics, as well as their test-retest reliability, were estimated across multiple spatial scales. Global metrics were more dynamic than local regional metrics. Cognitive components involving working memory, inhibition, attention, language and related neural networks exhibited high intra-individual variability. In contrast, inter-individual variability demonstrated a more complex picture across the multiple scales of metrics. Limbic, default, frontoparietal and visual networks and their related cognitive components were more differentiable than somatomotor and attention networks across the participants. Analyzing both intra- and inter-individual variability revealed a set of high-resolution maps on test-retest reliability of the multi-scale connectomic metrics. These findings represent the first collection of individual differences in multi-scale and multi-metric characterization of the human functional connectomes in-vivo, serving as normal references for the field to guide the use of common functional metrics in rfMRI-based applications.",

            "abstract": "Fibrolytic bacteria were isolated from the rumen of North American moose (Alces alces), which eat a high-fiber diet of woody browse. It was hypothesized that fibrolytic bacteria isolated from the moose rumen could be used as probiotics to improve fiber degradation and animal production. Thirty-one isolates (Bacillus, n = 26; Paenibacillus, n = 1; and Staphylococcus, n = 4) were cultured from moose rumen digesta samples collected in Vermont. Using Sanger sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene, culturing techniques, and optical densities, isolates were identified and screened for biochemical properties important to plant carbohydrate degradation. Five isolates were selected as candidates for use as a probiotic, which was administered daily to neonate lambs for 9 weeks. It was hypothesized that regular administration of a probiotic to improve fibrolysis to neonate animals through weaning would increase the developing rumen bacterial diversity, increase animal production, and allow for long-term colonization of the probiotic species. Neither weight gain nor wool quality was improved in lambs given a probiotic, however, dietary efficiency was increased as evidenced by the reduced feed intake (and rearing costs) without a loss to weight gain. Experimental lambs had a lower acetate to propionate ratio than control lambs, which was previously shown to indicate increased dietary efficiency. Fibrolytic bacteria made up the majority of sequences, mainly Prevotella, Butyrivibrio, and Ruminococcus. While protozoal densities increased over time and were stable, methanogen densities varied greatly in the first six months of life for lambs. This is likely due to the changing diet and bacterial populations in the developing rumen.",

            "abstract": "The human ability to flexibly alternate between tasks (i.e., task-switching) represents a critical component of cognitive control. Many functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have explored the neural basis of the task-switching. However, no study to date has examined how individual differences in intrinsic functional architecture of the human brain are related to that of the task-switching. In the present study, we took 11 task-switching relevant areas from a meta-analysis study as the regions of interests (ROIs) and estimated their intrinsic functional connectivity (iFC) with the whole brain. This procedure was repeated for 32 healthy adults based upon their fMRI scans during resting-state (rfMRI) to investigate the correlations between switching cost and the iFC strength across these participants. This analysis found that switch cost was negatively correlated with a set of iFC involved ROIs including left inferior frontal junction, bilateral superior posterior parietal cortex, left precuneus, bilateral inferior parietal lobule, right middle frontal gyrus and bilateral middle occipital gyrus. These connectivity profiles represent an intrinsic functional architecture of task-switching where the left inferior frontal junction plays a hub role in this brain-behavior association. These findings are highly reproducible in another validation independent sample and provide a novel perspective for understanding the neural basis of individual differences in task-switching behaviors reflected in the intrinsic architecture of the human brain.",

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND:Disordered interpersonal communication can be a serious problem in schizophrenia. Recent advances in computer-based measures allow reliable and objective quantification of nonverbal behavior. Research using these novel measures has shown that objective amounts of body and head movement in patients with schizophrenia during social interactions are closely related to the symptom profiles of these patients. In addition to and above mere amounts of movement, the degree of synchrony, or imitation, between patients and normal interactants may be indicative of core deficits underlying various problems in domains related to interpersonal communication, such as symptoms, social competence, and social functioning. METHODS:Nonverbal synchrony was assessed objectively using Motion Energy Analysis (MEA) in 378 brief, videotaped role-play scenes involving 27 stabilized outpatients diagnosed with paranoid-type schizophrenia. RESULTS:Low nonverbal synchrony was indicative of symptoms, low social competence, impaired social functioning, and low self-evaluation of competence. These relationships remained largely significant when correcting for the amounts of patients' movement. When patients showed reduced imitation of their interactants' movements, negative symptoms were likely to be prominent. Conversely, positive symptoms were more prominent in patients when their interaction partners' imitation of their movements was reduced. CONCLUSIONS:Nonverbal synchrony can be an objective and sensitive indicator of the severity of patients' problems. Furthermore, quantitative analysis of nonverbal synchrony may provide novel insights into specific relationships between symptoms, cognition, and core communicative problems in schizophrenia.",

            "abstract": "Titanium dioxide (TiO2) anatase nanoparticles (NPs) are metal oxide NPs commercialized for several uses of everyday life. However their toxicity has been poorly investigated. Cellular internalization of NPs has been shown to activate macrophages and neutrophils that contribute to superoxide anion production by the NADPH oxidase complex. Transmission electron micrososcopy images showed that the membrane fractions were close to the NPs while fluorescence indicated an interaction between NPs and cytosolic proteins. Using a cell-free system, we have investigated the influence of TiO2 NPs on the behavior of the NADPH oxidase. In the absence of the classical activator molecules of the enzyme (arachidonic acid) but in the presence of TiO2 NPs, no production of superoxide ions could be detected indicating that TiO2 NPs were unable to activate by themselves the complex. However once the NADPH oxidase was activated (i.e., by arachidonic acid), the rate of superoxide anion production went up to 140% of its value without NPs, this effect being dependent on their concentration. In the presence of TiO2 nanoparticles, the NADPH oxidase produces more superoxide ions, hence induces higher oxidative stress. This hyper-activation and the subsequent increase in ROS production by TiO2 NPs could participate to the oxidative stress development.",

            "abstract": "Phytoparasitic nematodes that are able to infect and reproduce on plants that are considered resistant are referred to as virulent. The mechanism(s) that virulent nematodes employ to evade or suppress host plant defenses are not well understood. Here we report the use of a genetic strategy (allelic imbalance analysis) to associate single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with nematode virulence genes in Heterodera glycines, the soybean cyst nematode (SCN). To accomplish this analysis, a custom SCN SNP array was developed and used to genotype SCN F3-derived populations grown on resistant and susceptible soybean plants. Three SNPs reproducibly showed allele imbalances between nematodes grown on resistant and susceptible plants. Two candidate SCN virulence genes that were tightly linked to the SNPs were identified. One SCN gene encoded biotin synthase (HgBioB), and the other encoded a bacterial-like protein containing a putative SNARE domain (HgSLP-1). The two genes mapped to two different linkage groups. HgBioB contained sequence polymorphisms between avirulent and virulent nematodes. However, the gene encoding HgSLP-1 had reduced copy number in virulent nematode populations and appears to produce multiple forms of the protein via intron retention and alternative splicing. We show that HgSLP-1 is an esophageal-gland protein that is secreted by the nematode during plant parasitism. Furthermore, in bacterial co-expression experiments, HgSLP-1 co-purified with the SCN resistance protein Rhg1 \u03b1-SNAP, suggesting that these two proteins physically interact. Collectively our data suggest that multiple SCN genes are involved in SCN virulence, and that HgSLP-1 may function as an avirulence protein and when absent it helps SCN evade host defenses.",

            "abstract": "Molecular genetics approaches in Phytophthora research can be hampered by the limited number of known constitutive promoters for expressing transgenes and the instability of transgene activity. We have therefore characterized genes encoding the cytoplasmic ribosomal proteins of Phytophthora and studied their suitability for expressing transgenes in P. infestans. Phytophthora spp. encode a standard complement of 79 cytoplasmic ribosomal proteins. Several genes are duplicated, and two appear to be pseudogenes. Half of the genes are expressed at similar levels during all stages of asexual development, and we discovered that the majority share a novel promoter motif named the PhRiboBox. This sequence is enriched in genes associated with transcription, translation, and DNA replication, including tRNA and rRNA biogenesis. Promoters from the three P. infestans genes encoding ribosomal proteins S9, L10, and L23 and their orthologs from P. capsici were tested for their ability to drive transgenes in stable transformants of P. infestans. Five of the six promoters yielded strong expression of a GUS reporter, but the stability of expression was higher using the P. capsici promoters. With the RPS9 and RPL10 promoters of P. infestans, about half of transformants stopped making GUS over two years of culture, while their P. capsici orthologs conferred stable expression. Since cross-talk between native and transgene loci may trigger gene silencing, we encourage the use of heterologous promoters in transformation studies.",

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND:Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), a serine protease inhibitor, is expressed and secreted by endothelial cells. Patients with PAI-1 deficiency show a mild to moderate bleeding diathesis, which has been exclusively ascribed to the function of PAI-1 in down-regulating fibrinolysis. We tested the hypothesis that PAI-1 function plays a direct role in controlling vascular integrity and permeability by keeping endothelial cell-cell junctions intact. METHODOLOGY\/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS:We utilized PAI-039, a specific small molecule inhibitor of PAI-1, to investigate the role of PAI-1 in protecting endothelial integrity. In vivo inhibition of PAI-1 resulted in vascular leakage from intersegmental vessels and in the hindbrain of zebrafish embryos. In addition PAI-1 inhibition in human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) monolayers leads to a marked decrease of transendothelial resistance and disrupted endothelial junctions. The total level of the endothelial junction regulator VE-cadherin was reduced, whereas surface VE-cadherin expression was unaltered. Moreover, PAI-1 inhibition reduced the shedding of VE-cadherin. Finally, we detected an accumulation of VE-cadherin at the Golgi apparatus. CONCLUSIONS\/SIGNIFICANCE:Our findings indicate that PAI-1 function is important for the maintenance of endothelial monolayer and vascular integrity by controlling VE-cadherin trafficking to and from the plasma membrane. Our data further suggest that therapies using PAI-1 antagonists like PAI-039 ought to be used with caution to avoid disruption of the vessel wall.",

            "abstract": "Gene synthesis is frequently used in modern molecular biology research either to create novel genes or to obtain natural genes when the synthesis approach is more flexible and reliable than cloning. DNA chemical synthesis has limits on both its length and yield, thus full-length genes have to be hierarchically constructed from synthesized DNA fragments. Gibson Assembly and its derivatives are the simplest methods to assemble multiple double-stranded DNA fragments. Currently, up to 12 dsDNA fragments can be assembled at once with Gibson Assembly according to its vendor. In practice, the number of dsDNA fragments that can be assembled in a single reaction are much lower. We have developed a rational design method for gene construction that allows high-number dsDNA fragments to be assembled into full-length genes in a single reaction. Using this new design method and a modified version of the Gibson Assembly protocol, we have assembled 3 different genes from up to 45 dsDNA fragments at once. Our design method uses the thermodynamic analysis software Picky that identifies all unique junctions in a gene where consecutive DNA fragments are specifically made to connect to each other. Our novel method is generally applicable to most gene sequences, and can improve both the efficiency and cost of gene assembly.",

            "abstract": "When different objects switch identities in the multiple identity tracking (MIT) task, viewers need to rebind objects' identity and location, which requires attention. This rebinding helps people identify the regions targets are in (where they need to focus their attention) and inhibit unimportant regions (where distractors are). This study investigated the processing of attentional tracking after identity switching in an adapted MIT task. This experiment used three identity-switching conditions: a target-switching condition (where the target objects switched identities), a distractor-switching condition (where the distractor objects switched identities), and a no-switching condition. Compared to the distractor-switching condition, the target-switching condition elicited greater activation in the frontal eye fields (FEF), intraparietal sulcus (IPS), and visual cortex. Compared to the no-switching condition, the target-switching condition elicited greater activation in the FEF, inferior frontal gyrus (pars orbitalis) (IFG-Orb), IPS, visual cortex, middle temporal lobule, and anterior cingulate cortex. Finally, the distractor-switching condition showed greater activation in the IFG-Orb compared to the no-switching condition. These results suggest that, in the target-switching condition, the FEF and IPS (the dorsal attention network) might be involved in goal-driven attention to targets during attentional tracking. In addition, in the distractor-switching condition, the activation of the IFG-Orb may indicate salient change that pulls attention away automatically.",

            "abstract": "Plants have evolved a variety of ways to defend themselves against biotic attackers. This has resulted in the presence of substantial variation in defense mechanisms among plants, even within a species. Genome-wide association (GWA) mapping is a useful tool to study the genetic architecture of traits, but has so far only had limited exploitation in studies of plant defense. Here, we study the genetic architecture of defense against the phloem-feeding insect cabbage whitefly (Aleyrodes proletella) in Arabidopsis thaliana. We determined whitefly performance, i.e. the survival and reproduction of whitefly females, on 360 worldwide selected natural accessions and subsequently performed GWA mapping using 214,051 SNPs. Substantial variation for whitefly adult survival and oviposition rate (number of eggs laid per female per day) was observed between the accessions. We identified 39 candidate SNPs for either whitefly adult survival or oviposition rate, all with relatively small effects, underpinning the complex architecture of defense traits. Among the corresponding candidate genes, i.e. genes in linkage disequilibrium (LD) with candidate SNPs, none have previously been identified as a gene playing a role in the interaction between plants and phloem-feeding insects. Whitefly performance on knock-out mutants of a number of candidate genes was significantly affected, validating the potential of GWA mapping for novel gene discovery in plant-insect interactions. Our results show that GWA analysis is a very useful tool to gain insight into the genetic architecture of plant defense against herbivorous insects, i.e. we identified and validated several genes affecting whitefly performance that have not previously been related to plant defense against herbivorous insects.",

METHODS:The PSMA-based inhibitor-lysine-urea-glutamate-coupled to the spacer Phe-Phe-D-Lys(suberoyl) and functionalized with the enantiomerically pure prochelator (R)-1-(1-carboxy-3-carbotertbutoxypropyl)-4,7-carbotartbutoxymethyl)-1,4,7-triazacyclononane ((R)-NODAGA(tBu)3), to obtain (R)-NODAGA-Phe-Phe-D-Lys(suberoyl)-Lys-urea-Glu (CC34). CC34 was labeled with 111In, 68Ga and 64Cu. The radioconjugates were further evaluated in vitro and in vivo in LNCaP xenografts by biodistribution and PET studies. Biodistribution studies were also performed with 68Ga-HBED-CC-PSMA (HBED-CC: N,N'-bis[2-hydroxy-5-(carboxyethyl)benzyl]ethylenediamine-N,N'-diacetic acid) and 111In-PSMA-617 for comparison. RESULTS:68Ga-CC34, 64Cu-CC34, and 111In-CC34 were prepared in radiochemical purity > 95%. 68\/natGa-CC34, 64\/natCu-CC34, 111\/natIn-CC34, 68\/natGa-HBED-CC-PSMA, and 111\/natIn-PSMA-617 exhibited high affinity for the LNCaP cells, with Kd values of 19.3 \u00b1 2.5 nM, 27.5 \u00b1 2.7 nM, 5.5 \u00b1 0.9 nM, 2.9 \u00b1 0.6 nM and 5.4 \u00b1 0.8 nM, respectively. They revealed comparable internalization profiles with approximately 75% of the total cell associated activity internalized after 3 h of incubation. 68Ga-CC34 showed very high stability after its administration in mice. Tumor uptake of 68Ga-CC34 (14.5 \u00b1 2.9% IA\/g) in LNCaP xenografts at 1 h p.i. was comparable to 68Ga-HBED-CC-PSMA (15.8 \u00b1 1.4% IA\/g) (P = 0.67). The tumor-to-normal tissue ratios at 1 and 2 h p.i of 68Ga-CC34 were also comparable to 68Ga-HBED-CC-PSMA (P > 0.05). Tumor uptake of 111In-CC34 (28.5 \u00b1 2.6% IA\/g) at 1 h p.i. was lower than 111In-PSMA-617 (52.1 \u00b1 6.5% IA\/g) (P = 0.02). The acquisition of PET-images with 64Cu-CC34 at later time points showed wash-out from the kidneys, while tumor uptake still remained relatively high. This resulted in an increased tumor-to-kidney ratio over time. CONCLUSIONS:68Ga-CC34 is comparable to 68Ga-HBED-CC-PSMA in terms of tumor uptake and tumor to normal tissue ratios. 64Cu-CC34 could enable high contrast imaging of PSMA positive tissues characterized by elevated expression of PSMA or when delayed imaging is required. 64Cu-CC34 is currently being prepared for clinical translation.",

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND:Confusion between look-alike and sound-alike (LASA) medication names (such as mercaptamine and mercaptopurine) accounts for up to one in four medication errors, threatening patient safety. Error reduction strategies include computerized physician order entry interventions, and 'Tall Man' lettering. The purpose of this study is to explore the medication name designation process, to elucidate properties that may prime the risk of confusion. METHODS AND FINDINGS:We analysed the formal and semantic properties of 7,987 International Non-proprietary Names (INNs), in relation to naming guidelines of the World Health Organization (WHO) INN programme, and have identified potential for errors. We explored: their linguistic properties, the underlying taxonomy of stems to indicate pharmacological interrelationships, and similarities between INNs. We used Microsoft Excel for analysis, including calculation of Levenshtein edit distance (LED). Compliance with WHO naming guidelines was inconsistent. Since the 1970s there has been a trend towards compliance in formal properties, such as word length, but longer names published in the 1950s and 1960s are still in use. The stems used to show pharmacological interrelationships are not spelled consistently and the guidelines do not impose an unequivocal order on them, making the meanings of INNs difficult to understand. Pairs of INNs sharing a stem (appropriately or not) often have high levels of similarity (<5 LED), and thus have greater potential for confusion. CONCLUSIONS:We have revealed a tension between WHO guidelines stipulating use of stems to denote meaning, and the aim of reducing similarities in nomenclature. To mitigate this tension and reduce the risk of confusion, the stem system should be made clear and well ordered, so as to avoid compounding the risk of confusion at the clinical level. The interplay between the different WHO INN naming principles should be further examined, to better understand their implications for the problem of LASA errors.",

            "abstract": "TMF\/ARA160 is known to be a TATA element Modulatory Factor (TMF). It was initially identified as a DNA-binding factor and a coactivator of the Androgen receptor. It was also characterized as a Golgi-associated protein, which is essential for acrosome formation during functional sperm development. However, the molecular roles of TMF in this intricate process have not been revealed. Here, we show that during spermiogenesis, TMF undergoes a dynamic change of localization throughout the Golgi apparatus. Specifically, TMF translocates from the cis-Golgi to the trans-Golgi network and to the emerging vesicles surface, as the round spermatids develop. Notably, lack of TMF led to an abnormal spatial orientation of the Golgi and to the deviation of the trans-Golgi surface away from the nucleus of the developing round spermatids. Concomitantly, pro-acrosomal vesicles derived from the TMF-\/- Golgi lacked targeting properties and did not tether to the spermatid nuclear membrane thereby failing to form the acrosome anchoring scaffold, the acroplaxome, around the cell-nucleus. Absence of TMF also perturbed the positioning of microtubules, which normally lie in proximity to the Golgi and are important for maintaining Golgi spatial orientation and dynamics and for chromatoid body formation, which is impaired in TMF-\/- spermatids. In-silico evaluation combined with molecular and electron microscopic analyses revealed the presence of a microtubule interacting domain (MIT) in TMF, and confirmed the association of TMF with microtubules in spermatogenic cells. Furthermore, the MIT domain in TMF, along with microtubules integrity, are required for stable association of TMF with the Golgi apparatus. Collectively, we show here for the first time that a Golgi and microtubules associated protein is crucial for maintaining proper Golgi orientation during a cell developmental process.",

            "abstract": "Mechanisms of resource allocation are essential for maternal and fetal survival, particularly when the availability of nutrients is limited. We investigated the responses of feto-placental development to maternal chronic protein malnutrition to test the hypothesis that maternal low protein diet produces differential growth restriction of placental and fetal tissues, and adaptive changes in the placenta that may mitigate impacts on fetal growth. C57BL\/6J female mice were fed either a low-protein diet (6% protein) or control isocaloric diet (20% protein). On embryonic days E10.5, 17.5 and 18.5 tissue samples were prepared for morphometric, histological and quantitative RT-PCR analyses, which included markers of trophoblast cell subtypes. Potential endocrine adaptations were assessed by the expression of Prolactin-related hormone genes. In the low protein group, placenta weight was significantly lower at E10.5, followed by reduction of maternal weight at E17.5, while the fetuses became significantly lighter no earlier than at E18.5. Fetal head at E18.5 in the low protein group, though smaller than controls, was larger than expected for body size. The relative size and shape of the cranial vault and the flexion of the cranial base was affected by E17.5 and more severely by E18.5. The junctional zone, a placenta layer rich in endocrine and energy storing glycogen cells, was smaller in low protein placentas as well as the expression of Pcdh12, a marker of glycogen trophoblast cells. Placental hormone gene Prl3a1 was altered in response to low protein diet: expression was elevated at E17.5 when fetuses were still growing normally, but dropped sharply by E18.5 in parallel with the slowing of fetal growth. This model suggests that nutrients are preferentially allocated to sustain fetal and brain growth and suggests the placenta as a nutrient sensor in early gestation with a role in mitigating impacts of poor maternal nutrition on fetal growth.",

            "abstract": "Beat-to-beat variability in repolarization (BVR) has been proposed as an arrhythmic risk marker for disease and pharmacological action. The mechanisms are unclear but BVR is thought to be a cell level manifestation of ion channel stochasticity, modulated by cell-to-cell differences in ionic conductances. In this study, we describe the construction of an experimentally-calibrated set of stochastic cardiac cell models that captures both BVR and cell-to-cell differences in BVR displayed in isolated canine action potential measurements using pharmacological agents. Simulated and experimental ranges of BVR are compared in control and under pharmacological inhibition, and the key ionic currents determining BVR under physiological and pharmacological conditions are identified. Results show that the 4-aminopyridine-sensitive transient outward potassium current, Ito1, is a fundamental driver of BVR in control and upon complete inhibition of the slow delayed rectifier potassium current, IKs. In contrast, IKs and the L-type calcium current, ICaL, become the major contributors to BVR upon inhibition of the fast delayed rectifier potassium current, IKr. This highlights both IKs and Ito1 as key contributors to repolarization reserve. Partial correlation analysis identifies the distribution of Ito1 channel numbers as an important independent determinant of the magnitude of BVR and drug-induced change in BVR in control and under pharmacological inhibition of ionic currents. Distributions in the number of IKs and ICaL channels only become independent determinants of the magnitude of BVR upon complete inhibition of IKr. These findings provide quantitative insights into the ionic causes of BVR as a marker for repolarization reserve, both under control condition and pharmacological inhibition.",

            "abstract": "Cys-loop receptors are membrane spanning ligand-gated ion channels involved in fast excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission. Three-dimensional structures of these ion channels, determined by X-ray crystallography or electron microscopy, have revealed valuable information regarding the molecular mechanisms underlying ligand recognition, channel gating and ion conductance. To extend and validate the current insights, we here present promising candidates for further structural studies. We report the biochemical and functional characterization of Cys-loop receptor homologues identified in the proteome of Alvinella pompejana, an extremophilic, polychaete annelid found in hydrothermal vents at the bottom of the Pacific Ocean. Seven homologues were selected, named Alpo1-7. Five of them, Alpo2-6, were unidentified prior to this study. Two-electrode voltage clamp experiments revealed that wild type Alpo5 and Alpo6, both sharing remarkably high sequence identity with human glycine receptor \u03b1 subunits, are anion-selective channels that can be activated by glycine, GABA and taurine. Furthermore, upon expression in insect cells fluorescence size-exclusion chromatography experiments indicated that four homologues, Alpo1, Alpo4, Alpo6 and Alpo7, can be extracted out of the membrane by a wide variety of detergents while maintaining their oligomeric state. Finally, large-scale purification efforts of Alpo1, Alpo4 and Alpo6 resulted in milligram amounts of biochemically stable and monodisperse protein. Overall, our results establish the evolutionary conservation of glycine receptors in annelids and pave the way for future structural studies.",

            "title": "Whole-Genome Saliva and Blood DNA Methylation Profiling in Individuals with a Respiratory Allergy.",
            "abstract": "The etiology of respiratory allergies (RA) can be partly explained by DNA methylation changes caused by adverse environmental and lifestyle factors experienced early in life. Longitudinal, prospective studies can aid in the unravelment of the epigenetic mechanisms involved in the disease development. High compliance rates can be expected in these studies when data is collected using non-invasive and convenient procedures. Saliva is an attractive biofluid to analyze changes in DNA methylation patterns. We investigated in a pilot study the differential methylation in saliva of RA (n = 5) compared to healthy controls (n = 5) using the Illumina Methylation 450K BeadChip platform. We evaluated the results against the results obtained in mononuclear blood cells from the same individuals. Differences in methylation patterns from saliva and mononuclear blood cells were clearly distinguishable (PAdj<0.001 and |\u0394\u03b2|>0.2), though the methylation status of about 96% of the cg-sites was comparable between peripheral blood mononuclear cells and saliva. When comparing RA cases with healthy controls, the number of differentially methylated sites (DMS) in saliva and blood were 485 and 437 (P<0.05 and |\u0394\u03b2|>0.1), respectively, of which 216 were in common. The methylation levels of these sites were significantly correlated between blood and saliva. The absolute levels of methylation in blood and saliva were confirmed for 3 selected DMS in the PM20D1, STK32C, and FGFR2 genes using pyrosequencing analysis. The differential methylation could only be confirmed for DMS in PM20D1 and STK32C genes in saliva. We show that saliva can be used for genome-wide methylation analysis and that it is possible to identify DMS when comparing RA cases and healthy controls. The results were replicated in blood cells of the same individuals and confirmed by pyrosequencing analysis. This study provides proof-of-concept for the applicability of saliva-based whole-genome methylation analysis in the field of respiratory allergy.",

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND:Tuberculosis (TB) remains a significant health problem in the Canadian Arctic. Substantial health system delays in TB diagnosis can occur, in part due to the lack of capacity for onsite microbiologic testing. A study recently evaluated the yield and impact of a rapid automated PCR test (Xpert\u00aeMTB\/RIF) for the diagnosis of TB in Iqaluit (Nunavut). We conducted an economic analysis to evaluate the expected cost relative to the expected reduction in time to treatment initiation, with the addition of Xpert\u00aeMTB\/RIF to the current diagnostic and treatment algorithms used in this setting. METHODS:A decision analysis model compared current microbiologic testing to a scenario where Xpert\u00aeMTB\/RIF was added to the current diagnostic algorithm for active TB, and incorporated costs and clinical endpoints from the Iqaluit study. Several sensitivity analyses that considered alternative use were also considered. We estimated days to TB diagnosis and treatment initiation, health system costs, and the incremental cost per treatment day gained for each individual evaluated for possible TB. RESULTS:With the addition of Xpert\u00aeMTB\/RIF, costs increased while days to TB treatment initiation were reduced. The incremental cost per treatment day gained (per individual investigated for TB) was $164 (95% uncertainty range $85, $452). In a sensitivity analysis that considered hospital discharge after a single negative Xpert\u00aeMTB\/RIF, the Xpert\u00aeMTB\/RIF scenario was cost saving. INTERPRETATION:Adding Xpert\u00aeMTB\/RIF to the current diagnostic algorithm for TB in Nunavut appears to reduce time to diagnosis and treatment at reasonable cost. It may be especially well suited to overcome some of the other logistical barriers that are unique to this and other remote communities.",

However, the interactive and instant nature of these applications (apps) made them an attractive choice for malicious cyber activities such as phishing. The forensic examination of IM apps for modern Windows 8.1 (or later) has been largely unexplored, as the platform is relatively new. In this paper, we seek to determine the data remnants from the use of two popular Windows Store application software for instant messaging, namely Facebook and Skype on a Windows 8.1 client machine. This research contributes to an in-depth understanding of the types of terrestrial artefacts that are likely to remain after the use of instant messaging services and application software on a contemporary Windows operating system. Potential artefacts detected during the research include data relating to the installation or uninstallation of the instant messaging application software, log-in and log-off information, contact lists, conversations, and transferred files.",

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND:Wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) spike development is the foundation for grain yield. We obtained a novel wheat mutant, dms, characterized as dwarf, multi-pistil and sterility. Although the genetic changes are not clear, the heredity of traits suggests that a recessive gene locus controls the two traits of multi-pistil and sterility in self-pollinating populations of the medium plants (M), such that the dwarf genotype (D) and tall genotype (T) in the progeny of the mutant are ideal lines for studies regarding wheat spike development. The objective of this study was to explore the molecular basis for spike abnormalities of dwarf genotype. RESULTS:Four unigene libraries were assembled by sequencing the mRNAs of the super-bulked differentiating spikes and stem tips of the D and T plants. Using integrative analysis, we identified 419 genes highly expressed in spikes, including nine typical homeotic genes of the MADS-box family and the genes TaAP2, TaFL and TaDL. We also identified 143 genes that were significantly different between young spikes of T and D, and 26 genes that were putatively involved in spike differentiation. The result showed that the expression levels of TaAP1-2, TaAP2, and other genes involved in the majority of biological processes such as transcription, translation, cell division, photosynthesis, carbohydrate transport and metabolism, and energy production and conversion were significantly lower in D than in T. CONCLUSIONS:We identified a set of genes related to wheat floral organ differentiation, including typical homeotic genes. Our results showed that the major causal factors resulting in the spike abnormalities of dms were the lower expression homeotic genes, hormonal imbalance, repressed biological processes, and deficiency of construction materials and energy. We performed a series of studies on the homeotic genes, however the other three causal factors for spike abnormal phenotype of dms need further study.",

            "abstract": "Previous studies from Multhoff and colleagues reported that plasma membrane Hsp70 acts as a tumour-specific recognition structure for activated NK cells, and that the incubation of NK cells with Hsp70 and\/or a 14-mer peptide derived from the N-terminal sequence of Hsp70 (TKDNNLLGRFELSG, TKD, aa 450-463) plus a low dose of IL-2 triggers NK cell proliferation and migration, and their capacity to kill cancer cells expressing membrane Hsp70. Herein, we have used flow cytometry to determine the influence of in vitro stimulation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from healthy individuals with IL-2 or IL-15, either alone or in combination with TKD peptide on the cell surface expression of CD94, NK cell activatory receptors (CD16, NK2D, NKG2C, NKp30, NKp44, NKp46, NKp80, KIR2DL4, DNAM-1 and LAMP1) and NK cell inhibitory receptors (NKG2A, KIR2DL2\/L3, LIR1\/ILT-2 and NKR-P1A) by CD3+CD56+ (NKT), CD3+CD4+, CD3+CD8+ and CD19+ populations. NKG2D, DNAM-1, LAMP1 and NKR-P1A expression was upregulated after the stimulation with IL-2 or IL-15 alone or in combination with TKD in NKT, CD8+ T cells and B cells. CD94 was upregulated in NKT and CD8+ T cells. Concurrently, an increase in a number of CD8+ T cells expressing LIR1\/ILT-2 and CD4+ T cells positive for NKR-P1A was observed. The proportion of CD8+ T cells that expressed NKG2D was higher after IL-2\/TKD treatment, when compared with IL-2 treatment alone. In comparison with IL-15 alone, IL-15\/TKD treatment increased the proportion of NKT cells that were positive for CD94, LAMP1 and NKRP-1A. The more potent effect of IL-15\/TKD on cell surface expression of NKG2D, LIR1\/ILT-2 and NKRP-1A was observed in B cells compared with IL-15 alone. However, this increase was not of statistical significance. IL-2\/TKD induced significant upregulation of LAMP1 in CD8+ T cells compared with IL-2 alone. Besides NK cells, other immunocompetent cells present within the fraction of peripheral blood mononuclear cells were influenced by the treatment with low-dose interleukins themselves or in combination with hsp70 derived (TKD) peptide.",

            "abstract": "Pollinators, such as bees, often develop multi-location routes (traplines) to exploit subsets of flower patches within larger plant populations. How individuals establish such foraging areas in the presence of other foragers is poorly explored. Here we investigated the foraging patterns of pairs of bumble bees (Bombus terrestris) released sequentially into an 880m2 outdoor flight cage containing 10 feeding stations (artificial flowers). Using motion-sensitive video cameras mounted on flowers, we mapped the flower visitation networks of both foragers, quantified their interactions and compared their foraging success over an entire day. Overall, bees that were released first (residents) travelled 37% faster and collected 77% more nectar, thereby reaching a net energy intake rate 64% higher than bees released second (newcomers). However, this prior-experience advantage decreased as newcomers became familiar with the spatial configuration of the flower array. When both bees visited the same flower simultaneously, the most frequent outcome was for the resident to evict the newcomer. On the rare occasions when newcomers evicted residents, the two bees increased their frequency of return visits to that flower. These competitive interactions led to a significant (if only partial) spatial overlap between the foraging patterns of pairs of bees. While newcomers may initially use social cues (such as olfactory footprints) to exploit flowers used by residents, either because such cues indicate higher rewards and\/or safety from predation, residents may attempt to preserve their monopoly over familiar resources through exploitation and interference. We discuss how these interactions may favour spatial partitioning, thereby maximising the foraging efficiency of individuals and colonies.",

            "abstract": "Favism is a life-threatening hemolytic anemia resulting from the intake of fava beans by susceptible individuals with low erythrocytic glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) activity. However, little is known about the metabolomic changes in plasma and liver after the intake of fava beans in G6PD normal and deficient states. In this study, gas chromatography\/mass spectrometry was used to analyze the plasma and liver metabolic alterations underlying the effects of fava beans in C3H- and G6PD-deficient (G6PDx) mice, and to find potential biomarkers and metabolic changes associated with favism. Our results showed that fava beans induced oxidative stress in both C3H and G6PDx mice. Significantly, metabolomic differences were observed in plasma and liver between the control and fava bean treated groups of both C3H and G6PDx mice. The levels of 7 and 21 metabolites in plasma showed significant differences between C3H-control (C3H-C)- and C3H fava beans-treated (C3H-FB) mice, and G6PDx-control (G6PDx-C)- and G6PDx fava beans-treated (G6PDx-FB) mice, respectively. Similarly, the levels of 7 and 25 metabolites in the liver showed significant differences between C3H and C3H-FB, and G6PDx and G6PDx-FB, respectively. The levels of oleic acid, linoleic acid, and creatinine were significantly increased in the plasma of both C3H-FB and G6PDx-FB mice. In the liver, more metabolic alterations were observed in G6PDx-FB mice than in C3H-FB mice, and were involved in a sugar, fatty acids, amino acids, cholesterol biosynthesis, the urea cycle, and the nucleotide metabolic pathway. These findings suggest that oleic acid, linoleic acid, and creatinine may be potential biomarkers of the response to fava beans in C3H and G6PDx mice and therefore that oleic acid and linoleic acid may be involved in oxidative stress induced by fava beans. This study demonstrates that G6PD activity in mice can affect their metabolic pathways in response to fava beans.",

However, these markers may be elevated in non-neoplastic conditions and may fail to identify most non-serous epithelial cancer subtypes. The objective of this study was to identify histotype-specific serum biomarkers for mucinous ovarian cancer. The candidate genes with mucinous histotype specific expression profile were identified from publicly available gene-expression databases and further in silico data mining was performed utilizing the MediSapiens database. Candidate biomarker validation was done using qRT-PCR, western blotting and immunohistochemical staining of tumor tissue microarrays. The expression level of the candidate gene in serum was compared to the serum CA125 and HE4 levels in a patient cohort of prospectively collected advanced ovarian cancer. Database searches identified REG4 as a potential biomarker with specificity for the mucinous ovarian cancer subtype. The specific expression within epithelial ovarian tumors was further confirmed by mRNA analysis. Immunohistochemical staining of ovarian tumor tissue arrays showed distinctive cytoplasmic expression pattern only in mucinous carcinomas and suggested differential expression between benign and malignant mucinous neoplasms. Finally, an ELISA based serum biomarker assay demonstrated increased expression only in patients with mucinous ovarian cancer. This study identifies REG4 as a potential serum biomarker for histotype-specific detection of mucinous ovarian cancer and suggests serum REG4 measurement as a non-invasive diagnostic tool for postoperative follow-up of patients with mucinous ovarian cancer.",

            "abstract": "Plants have evolved both constitutive and inducible defence strategies to cope with different biotic stimuli and stresses. Exposure of a plant to a challenging stress can lead to a primed state that allows it to launch a more rapid and stronger defence. Here we applied a metabolomic approach to study and compare the responses induced in Nicotiana tabacum cells by microbe-associated molecular pattern (MAMP) molecules, namely lipopolysaccharides (LPS), chitosan (CHT) and flagellin-22 (FLG22). Early response metabolites, extracted with methanol, were analysed by UHPLC-MS\/MS. Using multivariate statistical tools the metabolic profiles induced by these elicitors were analysed. In the metabolic fingerprint of these agents a total of 19 cinnamic acid derivatives conjugated to quinic acids (chlorogenic acids), shikimic acid, tyramine, polyamines or glucose were found as discriminant biomarkers. In addition, treatment with the phytohormones salicylic acid (SA), methyljasmonic acid (MJ) and abscisic acid (ABA) resulted in differentially-induced phenylpropanoid pathway metabolites. The results indicate that the phenylpropanoid pathway is activated by these elicitors while hydroxycinnamic acid derivatives are commonly associated with the metabolic response to the MAMPs, and that the activated responses are modulated by both SA and MJ, with ABA not playing a role.",

This extract is a well-known Chinese herbal medicine for the treatment of inflammation and immunity related diseases. The anti-inflammatory activities of the absorbed components were evaluated by measuring nitric oxide (NO) production and proinflammatory genes expression in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated murine RAW 264.7 macrophages. As a result, 54 components in Sarcandra glabra were detected in dosed rat plasma, and 36 of them were positively identified. Moreover, 23 metabolites were characterized and their originations were traced. Furthermore, 20 of the 24 studied components showed anti-inflammatory activities. These results provide evidence that this method efficiency detected constituents in plasma based on the anti-inflammatory mechanism of multiple components and would be a useful technique for screening multiple targets for natural medicine research.",

            "title": "The Non-Fimbriate Phenotype Is Predominant among Salmonella enterica Serovar Choleraesuis from Swine and Those Non-Fimbriate Strains Possess Distinct Amino Acid Variations in FimH.",
            "abstract": "Although most Salmonella serovars are able to infect a range of animal hosts, some have acquired the ability to cause systemic infections of specific hosts. For example, Salmonella enterica serovar Choleraesuis is primarily associated with systemic infection in swine. Adherence to host epithelial cells is considered a prerequisite for initial infection, and fimbrial appendages on the outer membrane of the bacteria are implicated in this process. Although type 1 fimbriae encoded by the fim gene cluster are commonly found in Salmonella serovars, it is not known whether S. Choleraesuis produces this fimbrial type and if and how fimbriae are involved in pathogenesis. In the present study, we demonstrated that only four out of 120 S. Choleraesuis isolates from pigs with salmonellosis produced type 1 fimbriae as assayed by the yeast agglutination test and electron microscopy. One of the 116 non-type 1 fimbria-producing isolates was transformed with plasmids carrying different fim genes from S. Typhimurium LB5010, a type 1 fimbria-producing strain. Our results indicate that non-type 1 fimbria-producing S. Choleraesuis required only an intact fimH to regain the ability to produce fimbrial appendages. Sequence comparison revealed six amino acid variations between the FimH of the non-type 1 fimbria-producing S. Choleraesuis isolates and those of the type 1 fimbria-producing S. Choleraesuis isolates. S. Choleraesuis that produced type 1 fimbriae contained FimH with an amino acid sequence identical to that of S. Typhimurium LB5010. Site-directed mutagenesis leading to the replacement of the non-conserved residues revealed that a change from glycine to valine at position of 63 (G63V) resulted in a non-type 1 fimbria-producing S. Choleraesuis being able to express type 1 fimbriae on its outer membrane. It is possible that this particular amino acid change prevents this polypeptide from proper interaction with other Fim subunits required for assembly of an intact type 1 fimbrial shaft in S. Choleraesuis; however, it remains to be determined if and how the absence of type 1 fimbriae production is related to the systemic infection of the swine host by S. Choleraesuis.",

However, the ideal mode of processing and presenting these immunogens for effective vaccination has yet to be determined. We used our recently described vaccine candidate based on full-length HCV E1 or E2 glycoproteins fused to the heterologous hepatitis B virus S envelope protein to compare the use of the E1 and E2 proteins as separate immunogens with their use as the E1E2 heterodimer, in terms of immunogenetic potential and the capacity to induce neutralizing antibodies. The specific anti-E1 and anti-E2 antibody responses induced in animals immunized with vaccine particles harboring the heterodimer were profoundly impaired with respect to those in animals immunized with particles harboring E1 and E2 separately. Moreover, the anti-E1 and anti-E2 antibodies had additive neutralizing properties that increase the cross-neutralization of heterologous strains of various HCV genotypes, highlighting the importance of including both E1 and E2 in the vaccine for an effective vaccination strategy. Our study has important implications for the optimization of HCV vaccination strategies based on HCV envelope proteins, regardless of the platform used to present these proteins to the immune system.",

            "abstract": "The neo (neomycin phosphotransferase) gene is widely used as a selection marker in the production of genetically engineered animals and plants. Recent attention has been focused on safety concerns regarding neo transgene expression. In this study, neo transgenic and non-transgenic piglets were randomly assigned into Group A and Group B to evaluate effects of neo transgene by studying changes in gut microbiota using high-throughput sequencing. Group A pigs were fed a standard diet supplemented with antibiotic neomycin; Group B pigs were fed a standard diet. We examined horizontal transfer of exogenous neo gene using multiplex PCR; and investigated if the presence of secreted NPT II (neo expression product) in the intestine could lead to some protection against neomycin in transgenic pigs by monitoring different patterns of changes in gut microbiota in Group A animals. The unintended effects of neo transgene on gut microbiota were studied in Group B animals. Horizontal gene transfer was not detected in gut microbiota of any transgenic pigs. In Group A, a significant difference was observed between transgenic pigs and non-transgenic pigs in pattern of changes in Proteobacteria populations in fecal samples during and post neomycin feeding. In Group B, there were significant differences in the relative abundance of phyla Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria, and genera Lactobacillus and Escherichia-Shigella-Hafnia between transgenic pigs and non-transgenic pigs. We speculate that the secretion of NPT II from transgenic tissues\/cells into gut microbiota results in the inhibition of neomycin activity and the different patterns of changes in bacterial populations. Furthermore, the neo gene also leads to unintended effects on gut microbiota in transgenic pigs that were fed with basic diet (not supplemented with neomycin). Thus, our data in this study caution that wide use of the neo transgene in genetically engineered animals should be carefully considered and fully assessed.",

            "abstract": "Triggering receptors expressed on myeloid cells (TREM) form a multigene family of immunoregulatory Ig-like receptors and play important roles in the regulation of innate and adaptive immunity. In chickens, three members of the TREM family have been identified on chromosome 26. One of them is TREM-B1 which possesses two V-set Ig-domains, an uncharged transmembrane region and a long cytoplasmic tail with one ITSM and two ITIMs indicating an inhibitory function. We generated specific monoclonal antibodies by immunizing a Balb\/c mouse with a TREM-B1-FLAG transfected BWZ.36 cell line and tested the hybridoma supernatants on TREM-B1-FLAG transfected 2D8 cells. We obtained two different antibodies specific for TREM-B1, mab 7E8 (mouse IgG1) and mab 1E9 (mouse IgG2a) which were used for cell surface staining. Single and double staining of different tissues, including whole blood preparations, revealed expression on thrombocytes. Next we investigated the biochemical properties of TREM-B1 by using the specific mab 1E9 for immunoprecipitation of either lysates of surface biotinylated peripheral blood cells or stably transfected 2D8 cells. Staining with streptavidin coupled horse radish peroxidase revealed a glycosylated monomeric protein of about 50 kDa. Furthermore we used the stably transfected 2D8 cell line for analyzing the cytoplasmic tyrosine based signaling motifs. After pervanadate treatment, we detected phosphorylation of the tyrosine residues and subsequent recruitment of the tyrosine specific protein phosphatase SHP-2, indicating an inhibitory potential for TREM-B1. We also showed the inhibitory effect of TREM-B1 in chicken thrombocytes using a CD107 degranulation assay. Crosslinking of TREM-B1 on activated primary thrombocytes resulted in decreased CD107 surface expression of about 50-70%.",

            "title": "Pharmacological Modulation of Hemodynamics in Adult Zebrafish In Vivo.",
            "abstract": "INTRODUCTION:Hemodynamic parameters in zebrafish receive increasing attention because of their important role in cardiovascular processes such as atherosclerosis, hematopoiesis, sprouting and intussusceptive angiogenesis. To study underlying mechanisms, the precise modulation of parameters like blood flow velocity or shear stress is centrally important. Questions related to blood flow have been addressed in the past in either embryonic or ex vivo-zebrafish models but little information is available for adult animals. Here we describe a pharmacological approach to modulate cardiac and hemodynamic parameters in adult zebrafish in vivo. MATERIALS AND METHODS:Adult zebrafish were paralyzed and orally perfused with salt water. The drugs isoprenaline and sodium nitroprusside were directly applied with the perfusate, thus closely resembling the preferred method for drug delivery in zebrafish, namely within the water. Drug effects on the heart and on blood flow in the submental vein were studied using electrocardiograms, in vivo-microscopy and mathematical flow simulations. RESULTS:Under control conditions, heart rate, blood flow velocity and shear stress varied less than \u00b1 5%. Maximal chronotropic effects of isoprenaline were achieved at a concentration of 50 \u03bcmol\/L, where it increased the heart rate by 22.6 \u00b1 1.3% (n = 4; p < 0.0001). Blood flow velocity and shear stress in the submental vein were not significantly increased. Sodium nitroprusside at 1 mmol\/L did not alter the heart rate but increased blood flow velocity by 110.46 \u00b1 19.64% (p = 0.01) and shear stress by 117.96 \u00b1 23.65% (n = 9; p = 0.03). DISCUSSION:In this study, we demonstrate that cardiac and hemodynamic parameters in adult zebrafish can be efficiently modulated by isoprenaline and sodium nitroprusside. Together with the suitability of the zebrafish for in vivo-microscopy and genetic modifications, the methodology described permits studying biological processes that are dependent on hemodynamic alterations.",

Bluetongue virus (BTV) is classified among category \"A\" diseases notifiable to the World Organization of Animal Health (OIE), and is transmitted among ruminants by biting midges of the genus Culicoides. Here, we developed a comprehensive occurrence data set to map the current distribution, estimate the ecological niche, and explore the future potential distribution of BTV globally using ecological niche modeling and based on diverse future climate scenarios from general circulation models (GCMs) for four representative concentration pathways (RCPs). The broad ecological niche and potential geographic distribution of BTV under present-day conditions reflected the disease's current distribution across the world in tropical, subtropical, and temperate regions. All model predictions were significantly better than random expectations. As a further evaluation of model robustness, we compared our model predictions to 331 independent records from most recent outbreaks from the Food and Agriculture Organization Emergency Prevention System for Transboundary Animal and Plant Pests and Diseases Information System (EMPRES-i); all were successfully anticipated by the BTV model. Finally, we tested ecological niche similarity among possible vectors and BTV, and could not reject hypotheses of niche similarity. Under future-climate conditions, the potential distribution of BTV was predicted to broaden, especially in central Africa, United States, and western Russia.",

            "title": "Comparative Transcriptome Analysis of Fetal Skin Reveals Key Genes Related to Hair Follicle Morphogenesis in Cashmere Goats.",
            "abstract": "Cashmere goat skin contains two types of hair follicles (HF): primary hair follicles (PHF) and secondary hair follicles (SHF). Although multiple genetic determinants associated with HF formation have been identified, the molecules that determine the independent morphogenesis of HF in cashmere goats remain elusive. The growth and development of SHF directly influence the quantity and quality of cashmere production. Here, we report the transcriptome profiling analysis of nine skin samples from cashmere goats using 60- and 120-day-old embryos (E60 and E120, respectively), as well as newborns (NB), through RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq). HF morphological changes indicated that PHF were initiated at E60, with maturation from E120, while differentiation of SHF was identified at E120 until formation of cashmere occurred after birth (NB). The RNA-sequencing analysis generated over 20.6 million clean reads from each mRNA library. The number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in E60 vs. E120, E120 vs. NB, and E60 vs. NB were 1,024, 0 and 1,801, respectively, indicating that no significant differences were found at transcriptomic levels between E120 and NB. Key genes including B4GALT4, TNC, a-integrin, and FGFR1, were up-regulated and expressed in HF initiation from E60 to E120, while regulatory genes such as GPRC5D, PAD3, HOXC13, PRR9, VSIG8, LRRC15, LHX2, MSX-2, and FOXN1 were up-regulated and expressed in HF keratinisation and hair shaft differentiation from E120 and NB to E60. Several genes belonging to the KRT and KRTAP gene families were detected throughout the three HF developmental stages. The transcriptional trajectory analyses of all DEGs indicated that immune privilege, glycosaminoglycan biosynthesis, extracellular matrix receptor interaction, and growth factor receptors all played dominant roles in the epithelial-mesenchymal interface and HF formation. We found that the Wnt, transforming growth factor-beta\/bone morphogenetic protein, and Notch family members played vital roles in HF differentiation and maturation. The DEGs we found could be attributed to the generation and development of HF, and thus will be critically important for improving the quantity and quality of fleece production in animals for fibres.",

            "abstract": "Route learning is key to the survival of many central place foragers, such as bees and many ants. For ants which lay pheromone trails, the presence of a trail may act as an important source of information about whether an error has been made. The presence of trail pheromone has been demonstrated to support route learning, and the effect of pheromones on route choice have been reported to persist even after the pheromones have been removed. This could be explained in two ways: the pheromone may constrain the ants onto the correct route, thus preventing errors and aiding learning. Alternatively, the pheromones may act as a 'reassurance', signalling that the learner is on the right path and that learning the path is worthwhile. Here, we disentangle pheromone presence from route confinement in order to test these hypotheses, using the ant Lasius niger as a model. Unexpectedly, we did not find any evidence that pheromones support route learning. Indeed, there was no evidence that ants confined to the correct route learned at all. Thus, while we cannot support the 'reassurance' hypothesis, we can rule out the 'confinement' hypothesis. Other findings, such as a reduction in pheromone deposition in the presence of trail pheromones, are remarkably consistent with previous experiments. As previously reported, ants which make errors on their outward journey upregulate pheromone deposition on their return. Surprisingly, ants which would go on to make an error down-regulate pheromone deposition on their outward journey, hinting at a capacity for ants to gauge the quality of their own memories.",

This study aimed to evaluate how UCP1 and UCP3 expression influences substrate oxidation and elicits possible changes in body composition in patients submitted to bariatric surgery. SUBJECTS\/METHODS:This is a longitudinal study comprising 13 women with obesity grade III that underwent bariatric surgery and 10 healthy weight individuals (control group). Body composition was assessed by bioelectrical impedance. Carbohydrate and fat oxidation was determined by indirect calorimetry. Subcutaneous adipose tissue was collected for gene expression analysis. QPCR was used to evaluate UCP1 and UCP3 expression. RESULTS:Obese patients and the control group differed significantly in terms of lipid and carbohydrate oxidation. Six months after bariatric surgery, the differences disappeared. Lipid oxidation correlated with the percentage of fat mass in the postoperative period. Multiple linear regression analysis showed that the UCP1 and UCP3 genes contributed to lipid and carbohydrate oxidation. Additionally, UCP3 expression was associated with BMI, percentage of lean body mass, and percentage of mass in the postoperative period. CONCLUSIONS:UCP1 and UCP3 expression is associated with lipid and carbohydrate oxidation in patients submitted to bariatric surgery. In addition, UCP3 participates in body composition modulation six months postoperatively.",

            "abstract": "ONSCREEN SMOKING IS A FORM OF TOBACCO MARKETING:Tobacco advertising has been prohibited in New Zealand since 1990, and the government has set a goal of becoming a smokefree nation by 2025. However, tobacco marketing persists indirectly through smoking in motion pictures, and there is strong evidence that exposure to onscreen smoking causes young people to start smoking. We investigated the relationship between exposure to smoking in movies and youth smoking initiation among New Zealand young adults. Data from an online survey of 419 smokers and non-smokers aged 18 to 25 were used to estimate respondents' exposure to smoking occurrences in 50 randomly-selected movies from the 423 US top box office movies released between 2008 and 2012. Analyses involved calculating movie smoking exposure (MSE) for each respondent, using logistic regression to analyse the relationship between MSE and current smoking behaviour, and estimating the attributable fraction due to smoking in movies. EFFECT OF SMOKING IN MOVIES ON NEW ZEALAND YOUTH:Exposure to smoking occurrences in movies was associated with current smoking status. After allowing for the influence of family, friends and co-workers, age and rebelliousness, respondents' likelihood of smoking increased by 11% for every 100-incident increase in exposure to smoking incidents, (aOR1.11; p< .05). The estimated attributable fraction due to smoking in movies was 54%; this risk could be substantially reduced by eliminating smoking from movies currently rated as appropriate for youth. We conclude that exposure to smoking in movies remains a potent risk factor associated with smoking among young adults, even in a progressive tobacco control setting such as New Zealand. Harmonising the age of legal tobacco purchase (18) with the age at which it is legal to view smoking in movies would support New Zealand's smokefree 2025 goal.",

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND:The KIDSCREEN-27 is a measure of child and adolescent quality of life (QoL), with excellent psychometric properties, available in child-report and parent-rating versions in 38 languages. This study provides child-reported and parent-rated norms for the KIDSCREEN-27 among Swedish 11-16 year-olds, as well as child-parent agreement. Sociodemographic correlates of self-reported wellbeing and parent-rated wellbeing were also measured. METHODS:A random population sample consisting of 600 children aged 11-16, 100 per age group and one of their parents (N = 1200), were approached for response to self-reported and parent-rated versions of the KIDSCREEN-27. Parents were also asked about their education, employment status and their own QoL based on the 26-item WHOQOL-Bref. Based on the final sampling pool of 1158 persons, a 34.8% response rate of 403 individuals was obtained, including 175 child-parent pairs, 27 child singleton responders and 26 parent singletons. Gender and age differences for parent ratings and child-reported data were analyzed using t-tests and the Mann-Whitney U-test. Post-hoc Dunn tests were conducted for pairwise comparisons when the p-value for specific subscales was 0.05 or lower. Child-parent agreement was tested item-by-item, using the Prevalence- and Bias-Adjusted Kappa (PABAK) coefficient for ordinal data (PABAK-OS); dimensional and total score agreement was evaluated based on dichotomous cut-offs for lower well-being, using the PABAK and total, continuous scores were evaluated using Bland-Altman plots. RESULTS:Compared to European norms, Swedish children in this sample scored lower on Physical wellbeing (48.8 SE\/49.94 EU) but higher on the other KIDSCREEN-27 dimensions: Psychological wellbeing (53.4\/49.77), Parent relations and autonomy (55.1\/49.99), Social Support and peers (54.1\/49.94) and School (55.8\/50.01). Older children self-reported lower wellbeing than younger children. No significant self-reported gender differences occurred and parent ratings showed no gender or age differences. Item-by-item child-parent agreement was slight for 14 items (51.9%), fair for 12 items (44.4%), and less than chance for one item (3.7%), but agreement on all dimensions as well as the total score was substantial according to the PABAK-OS. Visual interpretation of the Bland-Altman plot suggested that when children's average wellbeing score was lower parents seemed to rate their children as having relatively higher total wellbeing, but as children's average wellbeing score increased, parents tended to rate their children as having relatively lower total wellbeing. Children living with both parents had higher wellbeing than those who lived with only one parent. CONCLUSIONS:Results agreed with European findings that adolescent wellbeing decreases with age but contrasted with some prior Swedish research identifying better wellbeing for boys on all dimensions but Social support and peers. The study suggests the importance of considering children's own reports and not only parental or other informant ratings. Future research should be conducted at regular intervals and encompass larger samples.",

            "abstract": "Depression symptoms following immune response to a challenge have been reported after the recovery from sickness. A RNA-Seq study of the dysregulation of the microglia transcriptome in a model of inflammation-associated depressive behavior was undertaken. The transcriptome of microglia from mice at day 7 after Bacille Calmette Gu\u00e9rin (BCG) challenge was compared to that from unchallenged Control mice and to the transcriptome from peripheral macrophages from the same mice. Among the 562 and 3,851 genes differentially expressed between BCG-challenged and Control mice in microglia and macrophages respectively, 353 genes overlapped between these cells types. Among the most differentially expressed genes in the microglia, serum amyloid A3 (Saa3) and cell adhesion molecule 3 (Cadm3) were over-expressed and coiled-coil domain containing 162 (Ccdc162) and titin-cap (Tcap) were under-expressed in BCG-challenged relative to Control. Many of the differentially expressed genes between BCG-challenged and Control mice were associated with neurological disorders encompassing depression symptoms. Across cell types, S100 calcium binding protein A9 (S100A9), interleukin 1 beta (Il1b) and kynurenine 3-monooxygenase (Kmo) were differentially expressed between challenged and control mice. Immune response, chemotaxis, and chemokine activity were among the functional categories enriched by the differentially expressed genes. Functional categories enriched among the 9,117 genes differentially expressed between cell types included leukocyte regulation and activation, chemokine and cytokine activities, MAP kinase activity, and apoptosis. More than 200 genes exhibited alternative splicing events between cell types including WNK lysine deficient protein kinase 1 (Wnk1) and microtubule-actin crosslinking factor 1(Macf1). Network visualization revealed the capability of microglia to exhibit transcriptome dysregulation in response to immune challenge still after resolution of sickness symptoms, albeit lower than that observed in macrophages. The persistent transcriptome dysregulation in the microglia shared patterns with neurological disorders indicating that the associated persistent depressive symptoms share a common transcriptome basis.",

            "abstract": "PURPOSE:To evaluate the short-term changes in ocular surface measures and tear inflammatory mediators after femtosecond lenticule extraction (FLEx) and small-incision lenticule extraction (SMILE) procedures. METHODS:Eighteen subjects (18 eyes) underwent FLEx and 23 subjects (23 eyes) underwent SMILE in this single-center and prospective study. Central corneal sensitivity, Schirmer I test (SIT), noninvasive tear breakup time (NI-TBUT), tear meniscus height, corneal fluorescein (FL) staining, and ocular surface disease index (OSDI) were assessed in all patients. Concentrations of interleukin-1\u03b1 (IL-1\u03b1), tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), nerve growth factor (NGF), interferon-\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3), transforming growth factor-\u03b21 (TGF-\u03b21) and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) in collected tears were measured by multiplex antibody microarray. RESULTS:Central corneal sensitivity was reduced in both groups, but the scores in the SMILE group were higher than those in the FLEx group at all time points postoperatively (P<0.01). Lower FL scores and longer NI-BUT were observed in the SMILE group 1 week after surgery (P<0.05). OSDI scores in both groups increased rapidly at 1 day and 1 week postoperatively, then returned to their preoperative levels within 1 month (P<0.05). There were no significant differences in SIT or tear meniscus height between the two groups. Lower and faster recovery of tear NGF, TGF-\u03b21 and IL-1\u03b1 concentration were found in the SMILE group compared to the FLEx group postoperatively. No significant difference was found in tear TNF-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3 and MMP-9 for either group before or after surgery. Tear NGF, TGF-\u03b21 and IL-1\u03b1 show a correlation with ocular surface changes after FLEx or SMILE surgery. CONCLUSION:SMILE has superiority over FLEx in early ocular surface changes and NGF, TGF-\u03b21 and IL-1\u03b1 may contribute to the process of ocular surface recovery.

            "abstract": "In industrial computed tomography (CT), the mismatch between the X-ray energy and the effective thickness makes it difficult to ensure the integrity of projection data using the traditional scanning model, because of the limitations of the object's complex structure. So, we have developed a CT imaging method that is based on a spherical trajectory. Considering an unrestrained trajectory for iterative reconstruction, an iterative algorithm can be used to realise the CT reconstruction of a spherical trajectory for complete projection data only. Also, an inclined circle trajectory is used as an example of a spherical trajectory to illustrate the accuracy and feasibility of this new scanning method. The simulation results indicate that the new method produces superior results for a larger cone-beam angle, a limited angle and tabular objects compared with traditional circle trajectory scanning.",

            "abstract": "INTRODUCTION:While HIV-associated neurocognitive impairment remains common despite the widespread use of combined antiretroviral therapy (cART), there have been relatively few studies investigating the trajectories of neurocognitive change in longitudinal NeuroAIDS studies. OBJECTIVE:To estimate the magnitude and pattern of neurocognitive change over the first 3 years of follow-up using Group-Based Trajectory Analysis (GBTA) applied to participants in the longitudinal arm of the CHARTER cohort. METHOD:The study population consisted of 701 CHARTER participants who underwent neuropsychological (NP) testing on at least 2 occasions. Raw test scores on 15 NP measures were modeled using GBTA. Each trajectory was categorized as stable, improved or declined, according to two different criteria for change (whether the magnitude of the estimated change at 36 months differed \u2265 0.5 standard deviations from baseline value or changed by > the standard error of measurement estimated at times 1 and 2). Individuals who declined on one or more NP measures were categorized as decliners. RESULTS:Overall, 111 individuals (15.8%) declined on at least one NP test over 36 months, with the vast majority showing decline on a single NP test (93\/111-83.8%). The posterior probability of group assignment was high in most participants (71%) after only 2 sessions, and in the overwhelming majority of those with 3+ sessions. Heterogeneity of trajectories was the norm rather than the exception. Individuals who declined had, on average, worse baseline NP performance on every test, were older, had a longer duration of HIV infection and more follow-up sessions. CONCLUSION:The present study identified heterogeneous trajectories over 3 years across 15 NP raw test scores using GBTA. Cognitive decline was observed in only a small subset of this study cohort. Decliners had demographics and HIV characteristics that have been previously associated with cognitive decline, suggesting clinical validity for the method.",

            "abstract": "Tobacco smoking is inconsistently associated with breast cancer. Although some studies suggest that breast cancer risk is related to passive smoking, little is known about the association with breast cancer by tumor hormone receptor status. We aimed to explore the association between lifetime passive smoking and risk of breast cancer subtypes defined by estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor status among non-smoking Caucasian women. A hospital-based case-control study was performed in 585 cases and 1170 controls aged 28-90 years. Information on lifetime passive smoking and other factors was collected via a self-administered questionnaire. Logistic regression was used for analyses restricted to the 449 cases and 930 controls who had never smoked actively. All statistical tests were two-sided. Adjusted odds ratio of breast cancer was 1.01 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.72-1.41) in women who experienced exposure to passive smoking at work, 1.88 (95% CI: 1.38-2.55) in women who had exposure at home, and 2.80 (95% CI: 1.84-4.25) in women who were exposed at home and at work, all compared with never exposed regularly. Increased risk was associated with longer exposure: women exposed \u2264 20 years and > 20 years had 1.27 (95% CI: 0.97-1.66) and 2.64 (95% CI: 1.87-3.74) times higher risk of breast cancer compared with never exposed (Ptrend < 0.001). The association of passive smoking with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer did not differ from that with hormone receptor-negative breast cancer (Pheterogeneity > 0.05). There was evidence of interaction between passive smoking intensity and menopausal status in both overall group (P = 0.02) and hormone receptor-positive breast cancer group (P < 0.05). In Caucasian women, lifetime exposure to passive smoking is associated with the risk of breast cancer independent of tumor hormone receptor status with the strongest association in postmenopausal women.",

            "title": "The Effectiveness of Mindfulness-Based Interventions in the Perinatal Period: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.",
            "abstract": "Perinatal mental health difficulties are associated with adverse consequences for parents and infants. However, the potential risks associated with the use of psychotropic medication for pregnant and breastfeeding women and the preferences expressed by women for non-pharmacological interventions mean it is important to ensure that effective psychological interventions are available. It has been argued that mindfulness-based interventions may offer a novel approach to treating perinatal mental health difficulties, but relatively little is known about their effectiveness with perinatal populations. This paper therefore presents a systematic review and meta-analysis of the effectiveness of mindfulness-based interventions for reducing depression, anxiety and stress and improving mindfulness skills in the perinatal period. A systematic review identified seventeen studies of mindfulness-based interventions in the perinatal period, including both controlled trials (n = 9) and pre-post uncontrolled studies (n = 8). Eight of these studies also included qualitative data. Hedge's g was used to assess uncontrolled and controlled effect sizes in separate meta-analyses, and a narrative synthesis of qualitative data was produced. Pre- to post-analyses showed significant reductions in depression, anxiety and stress and significant increases in mindfulness skills post intervention, each with small to medium effect sizes. Completion of the mindfulness-based interventions was reasonable with around three quarters of participants meeting study-defined criteria for engagement or completion where this was recorded. Qualitative data suggested that participants viewed mindfulness interventions positively. However, between-group analyses failed to find any significant post-intervention benefits for depression, anxiety or stress of mindfulness-based interventions in comparison to control conditions: effect sizes were negligible and it was conspicuous that intervention group participants did not appear to improve significantly more than controls in their mindfulness skills. The interventions offered often deviated from traditional mindfulness-based cognitive therapy or mindfulness-based stress reduction programmes, and there was also a tendency for studies to focus on healthy rather than clinical populations, and on antenatal rather than postnatal populations. It is argued that these and other limitations with the included studies and their interventions may have been partly responsible for the lack of significant between-group effects. The implications of the findings and recommendations for future research are discussed.",

            "title": "Differences of Intra-Articular Graft Length between Sandwich-Style Reconstruction and Zhao-Style Non-Remnant-Preserving Double-Bundle Reconstruction of Posterior Cruciate Ligament.",
            "abstract": "Appropriate graft length within the joint and inside the osseous tunnel is essential for achieving posterior stability and adequate anchorage strength. Because of the curving path and thickness of the graft in double-bundle posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) reconstruction, especially in double-bundle PCL augmentation (with remnant preservation), the actual intra-articular length of PCL grafts, which remains unknown, may be longer than previously published values. The main purpose of the current study is to measure the actual intra-articular graft length required in sandwich-style PCL reconstruction (remnant-preserving double-bundle PCL augmentation) and Zhao-style non-remnant-preserving double-bundle PCL reconstruction (semi-anatomic double-bundle PCL reconstruction using double-double tunnel with tibial medial and lateral arrangement). Nine matched pairs of intact cadaveric knees were randomized between two groups and respectively received sandwich-style PCL reconstruction (remnant-preserving group) and Zhao-style non-remnant-preserving double-bundle PCL reconstruction (non-remnant-preserving group). The tunnel positions were exactly the same in two groups. The anterolateral (AL) bundle was reconstructed with four-stranded semitendinosus tendon, and the posteromedial (PM) bundle was reconstructed with four-stranded gracilis tendon. For each bundle, the length of the graft portion within the joint was measured. The current study indicated that in remnant-preserving group, the average intra-articular exposed portion was 42.0 mm (SD, 1.3 mm; range, 40.0 mm to 43.4 mm) for the AL bundle and 32.5 mm (SD, 2.9 mm; range, 27.8 mm to 35.8 mm) for the PM bundle. In non-remnant-preserving group, the intra-articular exposed portion was 34.5 mm (SD, 1.0 mm; range, 32.7 mm to 36.0 mm) for the AL bundle and 29.1 mm (SD, 2.1 mm; range, 25.2 mm to 31.9 mm) for the PM bundle. For both the AL and PM bundles, significant differences were found in average intra-articular graft length between the two groups. The current study, whose methodology is more rigorous and accurate by measuring the actual intra-articular graft length, has direct applications to clinical practice. When considering the total graft lengths during reconstruction, it is necessary to recognize that remnant PCL has a space occupation effect on graft and that remnant preservation requires longer intra-articular graft lengths than non-remnant preservation.",

            "abstract": "We hypothesize that insemination with fresh extended semen will improve the AI pregnancy rate due to its prolonged longevity in female reproductive tract compared to frozen thawed semen. The objective of this trial was to determine the effect of fresh and frozen semen on fixed-time AI pregnancy rate in beef cows synchronized with progesterone based CO-Synch protocols and inseminated at different estrus-AI intervals. Angus cross beef cows (N=180) were synchronized with CO-Synch-CIDR protocols for a fixed-time AI. A subset of cows (N=110) received Heatwatch estrus detection system's pressure sensor at CIDR removal to determine the time of estrus. Cows were divided into two groups, inseminated either at 47h (early) or at 67h (late) from CIDR removal with fresh extended (3 million sperm) or of frozen thawed (20 million sperm) semen. Results indicated that cows inseminated at 67 h had numerically higher fixed time AI pregnancy compared to cows inseminated at 47 h [44.4% (40\/90) vs. 33.3% (30\/90); P=0.13]. Cows inseminated with frozen thawed semen had similar fixed time AI pregnancy compared to fresh extended semen [40.8 (31\/76) vs. 37.5% (39\/104); P=0.66]. AI-estrus interval was divided into three groups &lt; 0 h (AI occurred before estrus), 0 to 16 h and &gt; 16 h (AI occurred 16 h after estrus). The AI pregnancy rates for fresh semen for the 3 estrus-AI intervals were similar to frozen semen. In conclusion, the fresh semen yielded similar AI pregnancy as frozen semen when inseminated at different estrus-AI interval in a fixed time AI breeding program in beef cows. [Vet.

Animals in both the groups received a basal diet comprising of roughages and concentrates separately to meet the maintenance and production requirements (ICAR, 1998). In addition, the animals in treatment group received yeast culture @ 0.5 g\/animal\/day. The average DMI of buffaloes during the digestion trial was 114.31 and 119.24 g\/kg W0.75 respectively, in control and treatment groups. The digestibility coefficients of gross nutrients and fibre fractions showed non-significant differences between the control and treatment groups, though the values were found to be comparatively higher in the yeast supplemented group. The DCP and TDN contents were observed to be 8.03 and 53.06 per cent in control group and 8.15 and 54.06 per cent in treatment groups, respectively. It can be concluded that yeast culture did not show any significant positive effect on nutrient utilization in graded Murrah buffaloes.  [Veterinary World 2011; 4(1.000): 22-24] ",

            "abstract": "The experiment was conducted to evaluate the bromatological characteristics and the in vitro digestibility of four sugarcane varieties, subjected or not to hydrolysis, with quicklime. A completely randomized design was employed with three replications arranged in a 4 \u00d7 2 factorial scheme, with four sugarcane varieties (SP 52454, RB 867515, RB 855536 and IAC 862480), hydrolyzed or not. There was significant effect on brix (p < 0.05) and industrial fiber (p < 0.05), and IAC 862480 variety had the lowest levels of industrial fiber. There were no significant difference (p > 0.05) in neutral detergent fiber, acid detergent fiber and lignin levels among the sugarcane varieties under analysis and for the sugarcanes, hydrolyzed or not. The use of sugarcane hydrolysis with 1% quicklime improves the in vitro digestibility of NDF and ADF, regardless of the variety studied. Hydrolysis with 1% quicklime did not alter the sugarcane chemical composition.<br><br>O experimento foi conduzido para avaliar as caracter\u00edsticas bromatol\u00f3gicas e a digestibilidade in vitro de quatro variedades de cana-de-a\u00e7\u00facar submetidas ou n\u00e3o \u00e0 hidr\u00f3lise com cal virgem. Utilizou-se delineamento inteiramente casualizado com tr\u00eas repeti\u00e7\u00f5es, arranjadas em esquema fatorial 4 \u00d7 2, com quatro variedades de cana-de-a\u00e7\u00facar (SP 52454, RB 867515, RB 855536 e IAC 862480), hidrolisadas ou n\u00e3o. Houve efeito significativo para as caracter\u00edsticas brix (p < 0,05) e fibra industrial (p < 0,05), sendo a variedade IAC 862480 a que apresentou os menores teores de fibra industrial. N\u00e3o foram observadas diferen\u00e7as significativas (p > 0,05) nos teores de fibra em detergente neutro, fibra em detergente \u00e1cido e lignina entre as variedades de cana-de-a\u00e7\u00facar estudadas, bem como para cana-de-a\u00e7\u00facar hidrolisada ou n\u00e3o. O uso da hidr\u00f3lise da cana-de-a\u00e7\u00facar com 1% de cal virgem melhora a digestibilidade in vitro da FDN e FDA independente da variedade estudada. A hidr\u00f3lise com 1% de cal virgem n\u00e3o modificou a composi\u00e7\u00e3o qu\u00edmico-bromatol\u00f3gica da cana-de-a\u00e7\u00facar.",

Mainly serum glucose, total protein, albumin, albumin globulin ratio, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine and calcium were studied. Colorimetric method was used for quantitative estimation of biochemical profile. Twenty-seven animals with recent history of calving and subsequent metritis were included in the study. On analysis, serum glucose was found to be 22.3 &amp;#177; 2.18 mg\/dl, total protein 6.1 &amp;#177; 0.51 g\/dl, albumin 2.8 &amp;#177; 0.29 g\/dl, BUN 27 &amp;#177; 0.19 mg\/dl, creatinine 1.8 &amp;#177; 0.13 mg\/dl and calcium was 7.0 &amp;#177; 0.43 mg\/dl. On comparison of this result with normal values it was found that glucose and calcium was below the normal level and albumin fraction was less than the globulin. It was concluded that in postpartum metritis, cattle exhibit hypocalcaemia, hypoglycaemia and reduced globulin fraction, whereas total protein, albumin, BUN and creatinine did not exhibit much variation. Ketone bodies were present in urine of 90% of tested animals.  [Vet. World 2009; 2(1.000): 27-28] ",

            "abstract": "Background: Chemoresistance is the major cause of neoadjuvant treatment failure in breast cancer patients. Despite recent progress, the mechanism underlying chemoresistance remains to be further defined. Methods: Expression of G protein-coupled receptor 120 (GPR120) was analyzed by immunohistochemistry in the biopsies of primary breast cancer who subsequently underwent preoperative neoadjuvant chemotherapy. In vitro and in vivo loss- and gain-of -function studies were performed to reveal the effects and related mechanism of GPR120 signaling pathway in the chemoresistance of breast cancer cells. Findings: We identified that GPR120, a receptor for long-chain fatty acids, was important for the acquisition of chemoresistance in breast cancer cells. We showed that GPR120 expression was positively associated with clinical response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in patients. In breast cancer cells, GPR120 enhanced the de novo synthesis of fatty acids that served as GPR120 ligands to activate GPR120 signaling via a feedback mechanism. Upregulated GPR120 signaling rendered cells resistant to epirubicin-induced cell death by upregulating ABC transporters expression and thus decreasing the intracellular accumulation of epirubicin. Akt\/NF-\u03baB pathway was responsible for the GPR120-mediated expression of ABC transporters leading to modulation of the concentration of chemotherapeutic drugs in cells. The functional importance of GPR120 in chemoresistance was further validated using epirubicin-treated tumor xenografts, in which we showed that blockade of GPR120 signaling with AH7614 or GPR120-siRNA significantly compromised chemoresistance. Interpretation: Our results highlight that GPR120 might be a promising therapeutic target for breast cancer chemoresistance.

            "abstract": "Background: Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) remains difficult to be targeted. SET and cancerous inhibitor of protein phosphatase 2A (CIP2A) are intrinsic protein-interacting inhibitors of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) and frequently overexpressed in cancers, whereas reactivating PP2A activity has been postulated as an anti-cancer strategy. Here we explored this strategy in TNBC. Methods: Data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database was analyzed. TNBC cell lines were used for in vitro studies. Cell viability was examined by MTT assay. The apoptotic cells were examined by flow cytometry and Western blot. A SET-PP2A protein-protein interaction antagonist TD19 was used to disrupt signal transduction. In vivo efficacy of TD19 was tested in MDA-MB-468-xenografted animal model. Findings: TCGA data revealed upregulation of SET and CIP2A and positive correlation of these two gene expressions in TNBC tumors. Ectopic SET or CIP2A increased cell viability, migration, and invasion of TNBC cells. Notably ERK inhibition increased PP2A activity. ERK activation is known crucial for Elk-1 activity, a transcriptional factor regulating CIP2A expression, we hypothesized an oncogenic feedforward loop consisting of pERK\/pElk-1\/CIP2A\/PP2A. This loop was validated by knockdown of PP2A and ectopic expression of Elk-1, showing reciprocal changes in loop members. In addition, ectopic expression of SET increased pAkt, pERK, pElk-1 and CIP2A expressions, suggesting a positive linkage between SET and CIP2A signaling. Moreover, TD19 disrupted this CIP2A-feedforward loop by restoring PP2A activity, demonstrating in vitro and in vivo anti-cancer activity. Mechanistically, TD19 downregulated CIP2A mRNA via inhibiting pERK-mediated Elk-1 nuclear translocation thereby decreased Elk-1 binding to the CIP2A promoter. Interpretation: These findings suggested that a novel oncogenic CIP2A-feedforward loop contributes to TNBC progression and targeting SET to disrupt this oncogenic CIP2A loop showed therapeutic potential in TNBC.",

            "abstract": "Background: Locally advanced pancreatic cancer (LAPC) has a dismal prognosis with current treatment modalities and one-third of patients die from local progression of disease. Preclinical studies with orthotopic PC demonstrated dramatic synergy between radiotherapy (RT) and the poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1\/2 inhibitor (PARPi), veliparib. We conducted a phase I trial of gemcitabine, radiotherapy and dose-escalated veliparib in LAPC. Methods: This was a single institution investigator-initiated open-label, single-arm phase 1 clinical trial (NCT01908478). Weekly gemcitabine with daily IMRT and veliparib dose escalated using a Bayesian adaptive design were administered in treatment na\u00efve LA or borderline resectable PC. The primary end point was identification of the MTD. Secondary endpoints included efficacy, characterization of PAR levels using ELISA, DDR alterations with targeted next generation sequencing and transcriptome analysis, tumor mutation burden (TMB) and microsatellite instability (MSI) status. Findings: Thirty patients were enrolled. The MTD of veliparib was 40\u202fmg BID with gemcitabine 400\u202fmg\/m2 and RT (36\u202fGy\/15 fractions). Sixteen DLTs were identified in 12 patients. Grade\u202f\u2265\u202f3 adverse events included lymphopenia (96%) and anemia (36%). Median OS for all patients was 15\u202fmonths. Median OS for DDR pathway gene altered and intact cases was 19\u202fmonths (95% CI: 6.2\u201327.2) and 14\u202fmonths (95% CI: 10.0\u201321.8), respectively. There were no significant associations between levels of PAR, TMB, or MSI with outcomes. The DDR transcripts PARP3 and RBX1 significantly correlated with OS. Interpretation: This is the first report of a PARPi-chemoradiotherapy combination in PC. The regimen was safe, tolerable at the RP2D, and clinically active as an upfront treatment strategy in patients biologically unselected by upfront chemotherapy. Expression of the DDR transcripts, PARP3 and RBX1, were associated with OS suggesting validation in a follow up phase 2 study. Fund: Phase One Foundation; National Institutes of Health [1R01CA188480-01A1, P01 CA098912]. Veliparib was provided by Abbvie.

UV-B radiation was effective at enhancing morphological and biomass characteristics and decreasing chlorophyll contents of P.\u00a0vulgaris. Treatment of P.\u00a0vulgaris with artificial UV-B radiation significantly increased peroxidase (POD), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione (GSH) activities compared to the control treatment. UV-B radiation significantly increased the levels of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), malondialdehyde (MDA) and proline in leaves of P.\u00a0vulgaris compared to those of control plants. In addition, the contents of total flavonoids, rosmarinic acid, caffeic acid and hyperoside significantly increased under UV-B radiation. The total phenolic levels also increased under UV-B treatment. These results demonstrated that short-term UV-B radiation can enhance production of secondary metabolites in P.\u00a0vulgaris, resulting in increased spica yield compared to that of control plants.",

            "abstract": "Background: Polycystic ovarian syndrome is a complicated hereditary disorder which does not have specific reason and 6-10% of women at fertility age are involved. In other word we can say that this syndrome is a familial hereditary syndrome which developed with combination of environmental and genetic factors. Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is related to cardiovascular diseases and has psychological and neurological effects on life quality as well as uterine and breast cancers. The main criteria for diagnosis of polycystic ovarian syndrome are chronic anovulation and hyperandogenism and the sub-criteria are insulin resistance, hirsutism and obesity onset at menarche age, anovulation alternatively is associated with increased testosterone level and DHEA-S. The cause of polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCO) is unknown, but it could be the result of complex genetic factors which are evident at puberty onset, also hereditary and non-hereditary factors could be the cause of polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCO) phenotype. In many women with polycystic ovarian syndrome, the insulin level is high. It seems that high levels of insulin increase androgens production. High levels of androgens can cause acne, supernumerary hair growth, weight gain, and ovulation problem. Conclusion: Early diagnosis and treatment of polycystic ovarian syndrome could help to reduce long-term complications such as diabetes type II, high blood pressure, heart disease and stroke.",

            "abstract": "Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), belonging to the transforming growth factor-\u03b2 superfamily, regulate many cellular activities. The Use of recombinant human bone morphogenic protein\u20112 (rhBMP\u20112) in oral and maxillofacial surgery has seen a tremendous increase, yet the relation between rh-BMP2 and oral squamous cell carcinoma cells (OSCC) is not fully clear. \nThis study aimed to investigate the effect of rh-BMP2 on p53, a tumor suppressor gene, which is reported to be the most frequent target for genetic alterations leading to cancer during the progression of OSCC in the golden Syrian hamster Buccal pouches. \nMaterials and methods: Buccal pouches of 34 hamsters were painted with 0.5% DMBA in liquid paraffin three times per week for 14 weeks. 0.25\u00b5g of rhBMP-2 were injected in the 1st, 7th and 49th days in the Test group (BMP2 group: 17 hamsters), then biopsies were extracted. Expression of P53 was immunohistochemically investigated in the cancerous tissues. \nResults: p53 expression was noticed in 33.11% of \"BMP2 group\" samples and in 23.19% of \"control group\" samples, a valuable statistical difference was noticed P<0.05between the two groups. \nConclusion: 0.25\u00b5g of rhBMP-2 affects clearly on p53 expression within OSCC cells. BMPs should not be utilized in the presence of a developed oral cancer till more investigations clarify its fully roles and functions in this type of malignancies.",

            "abstract": "Circulated blood lymphocytes (PBL) of 41 workers occupationally exposed to Carbon di-sulfide (CS2) exposed from viscose industry were investigated to collect data on the effects and to find a possible relationship between in-vivo CS2 induced apoptosis and genotoxic effects. The subjects were divided into three groups: 41 subjects exposed to CS2 together with various confounding factors, another 41subjects inhabitants of Viscose industry partially exposed to CS2 in longperiods. The results were compared with 41 control subjects without known occupational exposure. Ambient air concentrations of CS2 were measured in different work places. Measures of genotoxicity included the determination of the frequencies of chromosomal aberrations (CA), sister-chromatid exchange (SCE), HPRT mutations (variant frequency, VF) and the measurement of UV-induced unscheduled DNA-repair synthesis (UDS). The percentages of premature centromere division (PCD) and of cells with a high frequency of SCE (HF\/SCE) were also scored. Apoptosis and cell proliferation were determined by flow cytometry. In both CS2 exposed groups, the apoptotic activity and the CA levels in PBLs were significantly higher than in controls. The CA was mostly breaks of the chromatid type. In the second group, which was partially exposed to CS2, CA were slightly lower in comparison with group I fully exposed to CS2 and other confounding factors, which may be attributed to a different rate of elimination of damaged lymphocytes as a consequence of CS2 induced apoptotic activity. In conclusion, the results demonstrate that exposure to CS2 induces apoptosis and CA, indicating an excess cancer risk among subjects occupationally exposed to CS2. The results also emphasize the importance of the measurement of occupationally exposed pollutants, such as CS2, in order to avoid genotoxic effects in the workers also habit of cigarette smoking and alcohol consumption among the viscose workers had a synergistic effect on inducing cancer risk.",

An examination of the reported decisions shows that the Act\u2019s potency is whittled down because the courts have failed to purposively construe its salient provisions. Even though the Act is a century old, no social or moral development justifies a change; so little is suggested to reform the formality part of the Act. Rather, the article undertakes a diligent examination of the Act to ascertain its object, and finds that it is the promotion of monogamy in a society where, for the most part polygamy is the norm. It proffers a construction of the Act that promotes this object. It also suggests a stern judicial attitude that urges each prospective spouse to consci- entiously address his\/her mind to his\/her self-serving obligation to comply with the prelimi- nary formalities in the Act.",

            "title": "Regional Cooperation on Shared Watercourses: The Policy and Legal Framework on Transboundary Water Resources in Mainland Tanzania",
            "abstract": "Mainland Tanzania (Tanzania) is endowed with diverse water sources, some of which straddle national boundaries. Tanzania is located within two regional economic blocks, the Southern African Development Community (SADC) and the East African Community (EAC), and it also borders the eight countries of Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi, Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Zambia, Malawi and Mozambique. The entire eastern part of Tanzania borders the Indian Ocean, which also houses the non-mainland territory of the United Republic of Tanzania, namely Zanzibar. All the neighbouring countries are state parties to SADC except Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda and Burundi who are partner states to the EAC. This article discusses the existing policy and legal framework for the ownership, use, access, protection and management of transboundary water, which is defined as water resources contained within drainage or river basins which cross the geographical boundaries of and are shared with more than one sovereign country. It examines the existing national framework as well as the regional and international framework relevant to Tanzania. The need for proper regulation of transboundary waters has never been more imminent because water-quality degradation along with the structural and physical scarcity of global water supplies are culminating in a diverse array of transboundary water conflicts, particularly among the riparian states. Transboundary waters limit the discretion of nations under the international law principle of permanent sovereignty over natural resources, under which a state has absolute powers over natural wealth and resources within its territorial boundaries. Since all countries are generally hydrologically linked, it is necessary to negotiate and clarify the rights and obligations owed by a country regarding transboundary waters.",

            "abstract": "We developed a land cover and land use mapping framework specifically designed for agricultural systems of the Sudan-Sahel region. The mapping approach extracts information from inter- and intra-annual vegetation dynamics from dense stacks of Landsat 8 images. We applied this framework to create a 30 m spatial resolution land use map with a focus on agricultural landscapes of northern Nigeria for 2015. This map provides up-to-date information with a higher level of spatial and thematic detail resulting in a more precise characterization of agriculture in the region. The map reveals that agriculture is the main land use in the region. Arable land represents on average 52.5% of the area, higher than the reported national average for Nigeria (38.4%). Irrigated agriculture covers nearly 2.2% of the total area, reaching nearly 20% of the cultivated land when traditional floodplain agriculture systems are included, above the reported national average (0.63%). There is significant variability in land use within the region. Cultivated land in the northern section can reach values higher than 75%, most land suitable for agriculture is already under cultivation and there is limited land for future agricultural expansion. Marginal lands, not suitable for permanent agriculture, can reach 30% of the land at lower altitudes in the northeast and northwest. In contrast, the southern section presents lower land use intensity that results in a complex landscape that intertwines areas farms and larger patches of natural vegetation. This map improves the spatial detail of existing sources of LCLU information for the region and provides updated information of the current status of its agricultural landscapes. This study demonstrates the feasibility of multi temporal medium resolution remote sensing data to provide detailed and up-to-date information about agricultural systems in arid and sub arid landscapes of the Sahel region.",

            "abstract": "Information entropy and interclass separability are adopted as the evaluation criteria of dimension reduction for hyperspectral remote sensor data. However, it is rather single-faceted to simply use either information entropy or interclass separability as evaluation criteria, and will lead to a single-target problem. In this case, the chosen optimal band combination may be unfavorable for the improvement of follow-up classification accuracy. Thus, in this work, inter-band correlation is considered as the premise, and information entropy and interclass separability are synthesized as the evaluation criterion of dimension reduction. The multi-objective particle swarm optimization algorithm is easy to implement and characterized by rapid convergence. It is adopted to search for the optimal band combination. In addition, game theory is also introduced to dimension reduction to coordinate potential conflicts when both information entropy and interclass separability are used to search for the optimal band combination. Experimental results reveal that compared with the dimensionality reduction method, which only uses information entropy or Bhattacharyya distance as the evaluation criterion, and the method combining multiple criterions into one by weighting, the proposed method achieves global optimum more easily, and then obtains a better band combination and possess higher classification accuracy.",

            "abstract": "The surface of a complex material with a periodic structure is equivalent to the surface of a uniform material, and the measurement and data processing methods for the equivalent optical BRDF of a solar panel based on a large-scale spot are proposed. Based on a solar simulator, high-intensity light illuminometer, low-intensity light illuminometer and precise rotary platform, the BRDF automatic measurement platform is built. Spot size optimization and a measurement radius optimization method are proposed. The measurement results show that the BRDF of the solar panel has specular reflection characteristics, but that it still differs from the solar cell in the half width of the BRDF curve. Measurement error analysis is performed for the measurement process; its value is 6.74%. The measurement results can be used to improve the understanding of the optical reflection characteristics of the solar panel. Meanwhile, the method can also be used to measure and characterize the coatings of heat insulation material and scattering coating. The measurement data also has practical reference value for evaluations of improvements of the light absorption of the surface functional material. Finally, it can be used to simulate the target image scene.",

            "abstract": "The aim of this study was to characterize a collection of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) isolates of human and animal origin from Serbia. In total, 36 MRSA isolates&mdash;30 obtained from humans and six from companion animals&mdash;were investigated by PCR for the presence of antibiotic and biocide resistance determinants and virulence genes (PVL&mdash;Panton&ndash;Valentine leukocidin, ETs&mdash;exfoliative toxins, TSST&mdash;toxic shock syndrome toxin, SEs&mdash;staphylococcal enterotoxins, and MSCRAMMs&mdash;microbial surface components recognizing adhesive matrix molecules and biofilm). Isolates were analyzed by staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec), spa, and dru typing, as well as by multiple locus variable number of tandem repeat analyses (MLVA), multilocus sequence typing (MLST), and subsequently, eBURST. The majority of human MRSA isolates were resistant to gentamicin, erythromycin, clindamycin, and ciprofloxacin. Different antibiotic resistance genes were detected: aac-aphD, ant(6&prime;)-Ia, erm(A), erm(B), erm(C), tet(K), tet(M), fexA, and catpC221. All isolates were susceptible to teicoplanin and linezolid. SCCmec type III was prevalent in human isolates, while SCCmec elements in animals were mostly nontypeable. t037 was the predominant spa type in human and t242 in animal MRSA isolates. The prevalent dru type was dt11c in human and dt10a in animal MRSA isolates. MRSA isolates exhibited 27 different MLVA types. ST239 was predominant in human, while ST5 was prevalent in canine MRSA isolates. PVL was found in two, while tsst-1 was detected in three human isolates. Human-associated clones belonging to ST5, ST45, and ST239 MRSA clones were discovered in companion animals, which suggests anthropozoonotic transmission.",

Products from ginger, including oil and fresh and dried rhizomes can be used to treat malaria, asthma, headaches, and act as anti-inflammatory and anti-microbial agents. The cultivation of wild plant species can alleviate the pressure from harvesting from the wild. Under cultivation, the major constraints on crop yield and quality are water availability and plant nutrition. Therefore, the impact of water stress on commercial and African ginger was assessed in the rain shelter study. Irrigation treatments were based on the maximum allowable depletion (MAD) levels of plant available water in the root zone (T1: 20&ndash;25% MAD, the control; T2: 40&ndash;45% MAD; T3: 60&ndash;65% MAD; T4: 80&ndash;85% MAD). As water stress decreased, the plant height and number of stems per plant of both plant species were positively affected. The number of open stomata was higher for well-watered and less stressed treatments in both ginger species. Higher fresh and dry rhizome yields were recorded for commercial ginger at all water treatments as compared to those from African ginger. In general, water use efficiency (WUE) of fresh and dry rhizome yield was higher for commercial ginger as compared to the indigenous African ginger, while moderately stressed treatments generally resulted in the highest WUE for both species.",

            "abstract": "Comprehensive understanding of the regulatory mechanism of the implantation process in pigs is crucial for reproductive success. The endometrium plays an important role in regulating the establishment and maintenance of gestation. The goal of the current study was to determine the effect of adiponectin on the global expression pattern of genes and relationships among differentially expressed genes (DE-genes) in the porcine endometrium during implantation using microarrays. Diverse transcriptome analyses including gene ontology (GO), biological pathway, networks, and DE-gene analyses were performed. Adiponectin altered the expression of 1286 genes with fold-change (FC) values greater than 1.2 (p &lt; 0.05). The expression of 560 genes were upregulated and 726 downregulated in the endometrium treated with adiponectin. Thirteen genes were selected for real-time PCR validation of differential expression based on a known role in metabolism, steroid and prostaglandin synthesis, interleukin and growth factor action, and embryo implantation. Functional analysis of the relationship between DE-genes indicated that adiponectin interacts with genes that are involved in the processes of cell proliferation, programmed cell death, steroid and prostaglandin synthesis\/metabolism, cytokine production, and cell adhesion that are critical for reproductive success. The presented results suggest that adiponectin signalling may play a key role in the implantation of pig.",

            "abstract": "The stability and dynamics of cytoskeleton in brain nerve cells are regulated by microtubule associated proteins (MAPs), tau and MAP2. Both proteins are intrinsically disordered and involved in multiple molecular interactions important for normal physiology and pathology of chronic neurodegenerative diseases. Nuclear magnetic resonance and cryo-electron microscopy recently revealed propensities of MAPs to form transient local structures and long-range contacts in the free state, and conformations adopted in complexes with microtubules and filamentous actin, as well as in pathological aggregates. In this paper, we compare the longest, 441-residue brain isoform of tau (tau40), and a 467-residue isoform of MAP2, known as MAP2c. For both molecules, we present transient structural motifs revealed by conformational analysis of experimental data obtained for free soluble forms of the proteins. We show that many of the short sequence motifs that exhibit transient structural features are linked to functional properties, manifested by specific interactions. The transient structural motifs can be therefore classified as molecular recognition elements of tau40 and MAP2c. Their interactions are further regulated by post-translational modifications, in particular phosphorylation. The structure-function analysis also explains differences between biological activities of tau40 and MAP2c.",

            "abstract": "This paper presents a characterization study of specimens manufactured from Ti-6Al-4V powder with the use of laser engineered net shaping technology (LENS). Two different orientations of the specimens were considered to analyze the loading direction influence on the material mechanical properties. Moreover, two sets of specimens, as-built (without heat treatment) and after heat treatment, were used. An optical measurement system was also adopted for determining deformation of the specimen, areas of minimum and the maximum principal strain, and an effective plastic strain value at failure. The loading direction dependence on the material properties was observed with a significant influence of the orientation on the stress and strain level. Microstructure characterization was examined with the use of optical and scanning electron microscopes (SEM); in addition, the electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) was also used. The fracture mechanism was discussed based on the fractography analysis. The presented comprehensive methodology proved to be effective and it could be implemented for different materials in additive technologies. The material data was used to obtain parameters for the selected constitutive model to simulate the energy absorbing structures manufactured with LENS technology. Therefore, a brief discussion related to numerical modelling of the LENS Ti-6Al-4V alloy was also included in the paper. The numerical modelling confirmed the correctness of the acquired material data resulting in a reasonable reproduction of the material behavior during the cellular structure deformation process.",

Therefore, managing today's dynamic,\r\ncollaborative and networked nature of government environment is quite challenging. Real e-Government solution is expected to use, flexible and reusable technology to support valuable citizens and modern business expectations to access necessary government services and information. Here comes the requirement for more efficient ways of integrating their systems together under appropriate e-Government solution. It enables citizens and business organizations to interact with government on nearly all matters, 24\/7, without knowing which part of the government is providing the required service. In fact, much research work is being done in e-Business Integration but e-Government Integration is comparatively ignored. As a matter of fact, practical implementation of 'seamless' government across jurisdiction is the most challenging aspect of the future of e-Government which is the subject of our research. In this research, we first formalize\r\nthe basis\/requirements of such e-Government Integration framework as standard and then analyze all candidate software solutions which could help us in development of better and appropriate integrated solution of e-Government, and\r\nfinally develop the required e-Government Integration framework that adheres to the requirements. Fulfilling our requirement, major approaches like SOA and EDA, transformation of supporting technologies starting from Electronic Data Interchange to WS's and integration at processes level through XML are primarily\r\nexamined with the intent to give easy to use, reusable, flexible, scalable and adaptable e-Government Integration solution. Our proposed solution encompasses the most difficult problem of efficiently connecting varied inter e-Governments and intra e-Government activities with citizens and modern business\r\nconfigurations like: Virtual Organizations (VO), e-Enterprises, etc. allowing the governments to respond efficiently.",

            "abstract": "Endogenous DNA is primarily found intracellularly in nuclei and mitochondria. However, extracellular, cell-free (cf) DNA, has been observed in several pathological conditions, including autoimmune diseases, prompting the interest of developing cfDNA as a potential biomarker. There is an upsurge in studies considering cfDNA to stratify patients, monitor the treatment response and predict disease progression, thus evaluating the prognostic potential of cfDNA for autoimmune diseases. Since the discovery of elevated cfDNA levels in lupus patients in the 1960s, cfDNA research in autoimmune diseases has mainly focused on the overall quantification of cfDNA and the association with disease activity. However, with recent technological advancements, including genomic and methylomic sequencing, qualitative changes in cfDNA are being explored in autoimmune diseases, similar to the ones used in molecular profiling of cfDNA in cancer patients. Further, the intracellular origin, e.g., if derived from mitochondrial or nuclear source, as well as the complexing with carrier molecules, including LL-37 and HMGB1, has emerged as important factors to consider when analyzing the quality and inflammatory potential of cfDNA. The clinical relevance of cfDNA in autoimmune rheumatic diseases is strengthened by mechanistic insights into the biological processes that result in an enhanced release of DNA into the circulation during autoimmune and inflammatory conditions. Prior work have established an important role of accelerated apoptosis and impaired clearance in leakage of nucleic acids into the extracellular environment. Findings from more recent studies, including our own investigations, have demonstrated that NETosis, a neutrophil cell death process, can result in a selective extrusion of inflammatory mitochondrial DNA; a process which is enhanced in patients with lupus and rheumatoid arthritis. In this review, we will summarize the evolution of cfDNA, both nuclear and mitochondrial DNA, as biomarkers for autoimmune rheumatic diseases and discuss limitations, challenges and implications to establish cfDNA as a biomarker for clinical use. This review will also highlight recent advancements in mechanistic studies demonstrating mitochondrial DNA as a central component of cfDNA in autoimmune rheumatic diseases.",

            "abstract": "Beside its classical role as a serum effector system of innate immunity, evidence is accumulating that complement has an intracellular repertoire of components that provides not only immune defense, but also functions to maintain cellular homeostasis. While complement proteins, mainly the central component C3, have been detected in B cells, their exact function and source remain largely unexplored. In this study, we investigated the expression and origin of intracellular C3 in human B cells together with its role in B cell homeostasis. Our data provide evidence that endogenous expression of C3 is very low in human B cells and, in accordance with the recent publication, the main origin of intracellular C3 is the serum. Interestingly, we found that both serum-derived and purified C3 are able to enter the nucleus of viable B cells, suggesting its potential involvement in regulation of gene transcription. ELISA, gel shift assay, confocal microscopy, and chromatin immunoprecipitation proved that C3 and C3a strongly bind to nuclear DNA, and among the interacting genes there are key factors of lymphocyte development and differentiation. The strong interaction of C3 with histone proteins and its potential ability to induce chromatin rearrangement suggest that C3\/C3a might regulate DNA transcription via chromatin remodeling. Our data reveal a novel, hitherto undescribed role of C3 in immune cell homeostasis, which further extends the repertoire how complement links innate and adaptive immunity and regulates basic processes of the cells.",

The method used was Revealed Comparative Advantage (RCA), Export Product Dynamic (EPD), and X-Model product export potential. The research showed that Vietnam and Canada had a similar level of export structure to Indonesia in the ASEAN market so that Indonesia would have a high competition with both countries. Indonesian fishery products showed a high competitiveness in the export destination markets, except Philippines and Canada. The market position of Indonesian fishery products in Philippines, Thailand and Canadian markets was in the rising star and lost opportunity. These countries also showed as an optimist and potential market for Indonesian fishery products. The policy implication is that government and private sector need to prioritize the export of fishery products to Thailand, Philippines and Canada by improving the product competitiveness through quality improvement and production cost efficiency",

The empirical method used in this study derived from the gravity model that considers the effect of distance on trade activities behavior. Two causes of change in the elasticity of trade to distance will be exposed, i.e., the distance sensitivity effect (within industries) and the compositional effect (among industries). Specifically, this study would like to prove whether the distance sensitivity effect is more dominant than the compositional effect in explaining the change in distance elasticity of trade. By using four sub-periods and around two hundred industries involved, the result shows that the increase in the role of distance in trade heavily caused by the escalation of distance sensitivity effect in most industries.",

On the stage of a miserable theater, Pasolini displays in C<em>he cosa sono le nuvole<\/em> (1967) the story of some living puppets that are drawn to represent Shakespeare\u2019s Othello on demand of an omn ipotent puppeteer. The audience\u2019s answer will be unexpected. On the other hand, in <em>Los cuernos de don Friolera <\/em>(1930) Valle- Incl\u00e1n masks his own Othello as a grotesque guardia civil trapped in the middle of rural, moral and despotic Spain; the story of whom is, again, seen by an audience, in this case, two intellectuals that reflect on art, posterity and triumph. Tragedy, disguised by laughter and fiction, exceeds the frontiers of tradit ional theatre to make us accomplices and, as Shakespeare would say, players. A game of Russian dolls that reminds us of the Foucaultian Meninas experience: us, the voyeurs, are effectively inside the scene, we finish the work of art. The funambulesque muse has played her game, and the theatrical stage has become a mirror.",

But the discovery of many new documents in these years permitted to know the plots written (but not realized9 by the Author from 1933 till 1952 (there are three different plots: <em>Il diavolo<\/em>,<em> Miss Italia<\/em> and <em>Verranno a te sull\u2019aure<\/em>). It is also possible to have a clear idea of the collaboration with some directors like: Alberto Lattuada, Luchino Visconti, Franco Zeffirelli, Pier Paolo Pasolini. A close analysis of the cinematographic version of the novel <em>L\u2019Isola di Arturo<\/em>, directed by Damiano Damiani in 1962, permits to determine that the dissatisfaction which Morante expressed in many circumstances derives from a lack of dialogue between her and the director damiano Damiani.",

Si bien es cierto que ambos textos mantienen la id\u00e9ntica peripecia central se aprecia que son mecanismos diferentes los que mueven tanto la poeticidad de las dos obras como sus intenciones y mensajes \u00faltimos. De esta forma, a pesar de un mismo punto de inicio y de un id\u00e9ntico punto de vista sobre los caracteres, cada autor crea un universo literario propio: la trama y el n\u00famero de personajes aumenta en Lope, se rebaja la carga intelectual presente en Boccaccio que es sustituida por el enredo amoroso y se da espacio a otras cuestiones nuevas y enriquecedoras que no estaban en la novella.",

To achieve this, the surface area of myotubes is often quantified, along with the nuclear fusion index (NFI). Existing methods of such quantification are time-consuming and subject to error-prone human input. We have developed MyoCount, an open-source program that runs via the freely available MATLAB Runtime and quantifies myotube surface area and NFI. MyoCount allows the user to adjust its parameters to account for differences in image quality, magnification and the colour channels used in generating the image. MyoCount measures of myotube surface area and NFI were compared to the mean of measures performed by two blinded investigators using ImageJ software (surface area R2 = 0.89, NFI R2 =0.87). For NFI, the mean coefficient of variation (CV) between two investigators (17.6 \u00b1 2.3%) was significantly higher than that between the investigator mean and MyoCount (13.5 \u00b1 1.4%). For measurements of myotube area, the CV did not differ between both analysis methods. Given these results and the advantages of applying the same image analysis method uniformly across all images in an experiment, we suggest that MyoCount will be a useful research tool and we publish its source code and instructions for its use alongside this article.",

            "abstract": "Background. The primary environmental risk associated with artisanal small-scale gold mining (ASGM) activities in Sekotong and Taliwang is waste discharged directly into the environment. This waste contains variable concentrations of heavy metals and a high level of mercury. When these elements are released into the environment, plants and animals can be contaminated. If mercury is methylated to methylmercury, levels can increase in concentration at each level of the food chain (biomagnify). Fish are a primary risk vector for methylmercury poisoning in humans, and represent a significant source of protein for the Sekotong and Taliwang communities.\nObjectives. The present study aimed to identify the concentration of mercury in fish from ASGM sites in Sekotong and Taliwang.\nMethods. Descriptive research was used to describe the mercury concentrations of fish in the present study. The fish species collected for the samples represented commercially available fish most commonly consumed by the community on a daily basis.\nResults. In Sekotong's ASGM area, the mercury concentration in Pilsbryoconcha exilis tissue was 596 ppb, 721 ppb for Sephia officinalis and 50% of the Euthynnus affinis samples had a high level of mercury, above the World Health Organization (WHO) maximum permissable limit for the sale of fish for human consumption of 0.5 ppb.\nConclusions. Some fish species from the studied ASGM sites had high mercury concentrations above the maximum permissible mercury concentration in edible fish tissue. The risks associated with mercury exposure from fish consumption threaten community health.\nEthics Approval. All experiments were performed in accordance with relevant local guidelines and regulations.\nCompeting Interests. The authors declare no competing financial interests.",

            "abstract": "Background. The burden of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in India is not well understood. Due to geographical and environmental heterogeneity, the epidemiological profile of COPD may not be uniform across the country. Studies carried out in small geographical areas can help to determine the prevalence and risk factors of COPD.\nObjectives. The present study was conducted in one city in northwest India in order to calculate prevalence in small geographically determined areas within the city as well as across socio-economic strata and adjoining neighborhoods.\nMethods. The present study was conducted in Ludhiana, an industrial town in Punjab, India. Residential colonies were identified in an industrial and nonindustrial area and all households were screened for COPD using the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease criteria and confirmed by spirometry. Information about exposure to possible risk factors was also collected from suspected cases of COPD. Cases were mapped on a digital map of the city and hotspots were identified.\nResults. Fifty-six cases of COPD were detected. More than half (71%) were in the industrial area. The overall prevalence rate of COPD in the city was 3.17 per 1 000. The highest prevalence (5.6\u20139.4 per thousand) was observed in the colonies of the industrial area. All surveyed colonies in the nonindustrial area showed a low prevalence (0.0 to 0.9 per thousand).\nConclusions. Hotspots were located in the industrial area and there was no such aggregation in the nonindustrial area. This suggests a potential association of industrial air pollutants with COPD. A strength of the present study is that it provides important baseline data. However, the study was limited, as it did not show a temporal association of exposure to air pollution and smoking with COPD.\nParticipant Consent. Obtained\nEthics Approval.

Domestic investment (DI) and foreign direct investment (FDI) can meet investment needs in this industry. This paper focuses on the nexus of the two types of investment in meeting investment needs in the manufacturing industry and the influence of those investments in relatively capital-intensive and relatively labor-intensive industrial groups. The aim is to evaluate the role of both types of investments and their benefits to the economy not only to the value-added but also in transferring technology and knowledge spillover from FDI to DI. The panel data regression was first to do to observe the differences between groups of relatively capital-intensive industrial samples and relatively labor-intensive industrial samples. The comparison results show that there are significant differences between the two industry groups so that it can be regressed on these two sample types, apart from the regression of the overall sample. The overall sample found that both FDI and DI influence the value-added of the manufacturing industry.",

This article examines the empirical relationship between monetary policy and commodity price by employing a vector auto-regression (VAR) Model to show its response in the case of Pakistan. In this paper, the research philosophy is employed based on Positivism with Deductive approach to recognizing the response of monetary policy shocks on commodity price. Recently, low-interest rates and excessive liquidity play a dynamic role in affecting the prices of the commodities market. Furthermore, the impact of monetary policy rate show significant result and seems to be huge in the economy of Pakistan massively. Besides, there is a stable relationship between monetary policy instrument and commodity prices even though the current financial crisis.",

In questo periodo temporale \u00e8 possibile osservare come la maggior parte dei giornalisti italiani commise il grave errore di sottovalutare la potenza criminale del gruppo terrorista e si ostin\u00f2 a collocare la banda armata ideologicamente tra i gruppi eversivi neofascisti, quando invece gli stessi brigatisti dichiaravano reiteratamente il loro marxismo-leninismo. Nella seconda parte dell\u2019articolo, si parla di come vennero analizzati, da parte dei principali periodici italiani, il sequestro e l\u2019assassinio dell\u2019onorevole Aldo Moro e di come le Brigate Rosse, durante il rapimento del magistrato D\u2019Urso, cercarono di utilizzare i mezzi di comunicazione per i loro fini criminali.",

In this direction, the most significant texts are considered <em>The Gold Rimmed Glasses <\/em>(where the tragic hero is an homosexual), <em>Behind the Door <\/em>and <em>The Heron<\/em>, but also the figure of Alberto (and somewhat of the protagonist and narrator) in <em>The Garden of the Finzi-Contini <\/em>and of Barilari in <em>One night in \u201843 <\/em>are the subject of thematic interpretation. The author claims that homosexual identity is not investigated itself and ontologically legitimized by Bassani, but takes the value of a metaphor for exclusion, even a violent one, as the one that struck, at the same time, Jewish identity after the enactment of Racial Laws in Italy. From this point of view, the doubt on the \u201cconformity\u201d of his own sexuality, the fear this sexuality would meet the regime\u2019s propaganda stereotypes, or (in <em>Behind the Door<\/em>) the liberating projection of these stereotypes on an antagonistic character and <em>alter ego <\/em>seem to inhabit the protagonists of the aforementioned novels and short stories and produce, with their diverted or evaded questions, the agony of false consciousness.",

            "abstract": "India, the second largest agro-based economy with year-round crop cultivation, generates a large amount of agricultural waste, including crop residues. In the absence of adequate sustainable management practices, approximately 92 seems a very small number of metric tons of crop waste is burned every year in India, causing excessive particulate matter emissions and air pollution. Crop residue burning has become a major environmental problem causing health issues as well as contributing to global warming. Composting, biochar production and mechanization are a few effective sustainable techniques that can help to curtail the issue while retaining the nutrients present in the crop residue in the soil. The government of India has attempted to curtail this problem, through numerous measures and campaigns designed to promote sustainable management methods such as converting crop residue into energy. However, the alarming rise of air pollution levels caused by crop residue burning in the city of Delhi and other northern areas in India observed in recent years, especially in and after the year of 2015, suggest that the issues is not yet under control. The solution to crop residue burning lies in the effective implementation of sustainable management practices with Government interventions and policies. This manuscript addresses the underlying technical as well as policy issues that has prevented India from achieving a long-lasting solution and also potential solutions that have been overlooked. However, effective implementation of these techniques also requires us to look at other socioeconomic aspects that had not been considered. This manuscript also discusses some of the policy considerations and functionality based on the analyses and current practices. The agricultural waste sector can benefit immensely from some of the examples from other waste sectors such as the municipal solid waste (MSW) and wastewater management where collection, segregation, recycling and disposal are institutionalized to secure an operational system. Active stakeholder involvement including education and empowerment of farmers along with technical solutions and product manufacturing can also assist tremendously. Even though the issue of crop residue burning touches many sectors, such as environment, agriculture, economy, social aspects, education, and energy, the past governmental efforts mainly revolved around agriculture and energy. This sectorial thinking is another barrier that needs to be broken. The government of India as well as governments of other developing countries can benefit from the emerging concept of nexus thinking in managing environmental resources. Nexus thinking promotes a higher-level integration and higher level of stakeholder involvement that goes beyond the disciplinary boundaries, providing a supporting platform to solve issues such as crop residue burning.",

            "abstract": "Recent animal studies found the potential of a collagen peptide derived from skate skin to have anti-obesity effects through the suppression of fat accumulation and regulation of lipid metabolism. However, no studies have yet been performed in humans. Here, this very first human randomized, placebo-controlled, and double-blinded study was designed to investigate the efficacy and tolerability of skate skin collagen peptides (SCP) for the reduction of body fat in overweight adults. Ninety healthy volunteers (17 men) aged 41.2 &plusmn; 10.4 years with a mean body mass index of 25.6 &plusmn; 1.9 kg\/m2 were assigned to the intervention group (IG), which received 2000 mg of SCP per day or to the control group (CG) given the placebo for 12 weeks and 81 (90%) participants completed the study. Changes in body fat were evaluated using dual energy X-ray absorptiometry as a primary efficacy endpoint. After 12 weeks of the trial, the percentage of body fat and body fat mass (kg) in IG were found to be significantly better than those of subjects in CG (&minus;1.2% vs. 2.7%, p = 0.024 and &minus;1.2 kg vs. 0.3 kg, p = 0.025). Application of SCP was well tolerated and no notable adverse effect was reported from both groups. These results suggest the beneficial potential of SCP in the reduction of body fat in overweight adults.",

            "abstract": "This paper presents a methodology to represent ocean wave power generation based on real data observation for significant wave height (SWH or     H s    ) and wave period (WP or T). This technique is based on a hybrid model, which considers Fourier series and stochastic differential equations, allowing a continuous time representation of the random changes in the parameters associated with wave power generation (    H s     and T). The methodology is explained, including estimation methods and a validation procedure. The data series generated by the models erre used to create simulated wave power output applying a transformed matrix and a theoretical model. The results validate the utilization of this technique, when the objective is to obtain a robust dynamic representation of a random process, oriented to linear studies.",

            "abstract": "Objectives: To assess the cost-effectiveness of workplace-delivered interventions designed to reduce sitting time as primary prevention measures for cardiovascular disease (CVD) in Australia. Methods: A Markov model was developed to simulate the lifetime cost-effectiveness of a workplace intervention for the primary prevention of CVD amongst office-based workers. An updated systematic review and a meta-analysis of workplace interventions that aim to reduce sitting time was conducted to inform the intervention effect. The primary outcome was workplace standing time. An incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was calculated for this intervention measured against current practice. Costs (in Australia dollars) and benefits were discounted at 3% annually. Both deterministic (DSA) and probabilistic (PSA) sensitivity analyses were performed. Results: The updated systematic review identified only one new study. Only the multicomponent intervention that included a sit-and-stand workstation showed statistically significant changes in the standing time compared to the control. The intervention was associated with both higher costs ($6820 versus $6524) and benefits (23.28 versus 23.27, quality-adjusted life year, QALYs), generating an ICER of $43,825\/QALY. The DSA showed that target age group for the intervention, relative risk of CVD relative to the control and intervention cost were the key determinants of the ICER. The base case results were within the range of the 95% confidence interval and the intervention had a 85.2% probability of being cost-effective. Conclusions: A workplace-delivered intervention in the office-based setting including a sit-and-stand desk component is a cost-effective strategy for the primary prevention of CVD. It offers a new option and location when considering interventions to target the growing CVD burden.",

The L6 ligand is based on the triazamacrocycle (tacn) ring that is functionalized by two flexible 2-pyridylmethyl and one rigid 2-aminophenyl groups. Reaction of this ligand with Fe(ClO4)2&middot;xH2O led to the complex [Fe(L6)](ClO4)2 (1), which was characterized as the first Fe(II) complex based on the unsymmetrical N-functionalized tacn ligand. The crystal structure revealed a discrete monomeric [FeL6]2+ entity in which the unsymmetrical N-functionalized triazacyclononane molecule (L6) acts as hexadentate ligand. As observed in the few parent examples that are based on the symmetrical N-functionalized tacn ligands, the triazacyclononane ring is facially coordinated and the N-donor atoms of the three functional groups (two pyridine and one aniline groups) are disposed in the same side of the tacn ring, leading to a distorted FeN6 environment. The magnetic studies of 1 revealed the presence of an incomplete spin crossover (SCO) transition above 425 K, whose progress would be prevented by a very exothermic thermal decomposition at ca. 472 K, as shown by thermogravimetric and DSC measurements.",

            "abstract": "This article presents the development of selected heavy metals contained in river sediments at selected sites along the B&iacute;lina River. It describes the situation before the large flood in 2013, the situation just after that flood, the situation approximately 1 year after the flood, and 4 years after the flood. The contents of selected heavy metals from industrial pollution originating from transport and industry located along the river flow were monitored. Since the situation in the river before the flood was also known, it was possible to assess the impact of the 2013 flood on the distribution of heavy metals in the settled sediments. The results obtained show that the heavy metal content has changed significantly. During the flood in 2013 there was an increase in the concentration of almost all the monitored elements compared to the situation before the flood and one year after the flood. This could be caused by the churning of sediments as a result of the flood. The only exception was Cd, the concentration of which did not change significantly. However, Cd is present in the sediment samples at a low concentration at the limit of quantification (LOQ), so the change may not be noticeable. In 2017, four years after the flood, an increase in the concentration of all the monitored elements was found. The highest increase in the content of the monitored elements was observed at the sites with the highest industrial pollution. Following the flood in 2014, there was a situation where no significant differences were observed in the content of metals at the individual sampling points in contrast to the values obtained in 2012, 2013, and 2017. As a result of sediment churning and re-settlement during and after the flood, the sediment became homogenized along the entire river flow. After a longer period of time that was not accompanied by floods, a significant increase in the heavy metal concentration was observed due to anthropogenic pollution. The results show that the effect of flooding is only temporal and that anthropogenic pollution is more important than the impact of floods.",

The tested solutions contained mainly zinc, germanium, indium, and tin. The influence of temperature, time, amount of added tannic acid and its purity was determined. The application of pure tannic acid allowed the precipitation of &gt;99% of germanium and decreased its concentration in a solution &lt;0.015 g\/dm3. It required ca. 11&ndash;13 g of pure tannic acid per each 1 g of dissolved germanium. The preferred process conditions for Ge precipitation using powder tannic acid were 90 &deg;C, 90 min, whereas for 20% aq. solution&mdash;5 min. It was found that 40% to 50% of tin coprecipitated at these conditions. Therefore, a detinning operation using hydrogen peroxide was proposed. It allowed the removal of &gt;99% Sn and reduced its concentration in the solution below 0.025 g\/dm3.",

            "abstract": "Chemerin, a novel adipokine, has been associated with metabolic, inflammatory, and atherosclerotic diseases. We aimed to determine the genetic basis of chemerin levels by conducting a genome-wide association study (GWAS) and to investigate the role of RARRES2 polymorphisms and circulating chemerin levels in the long-term outcome of coronary artery disease (CAD). A total of 2197 participants from the Taiwan Biobank (TWB) were recruited for the GWAS analysis, and 481 patients with angiographically confirmed CAD were enrolled for long-term outcome analysis. One locus of genome-wide significance with a single independent association signal was identified in the GWAS for chemerin levels with the peak association at the RARRES2 gene promoter region polymorphism rs3735167 (p = 2.35 &times; 10&minus;21). In the CAD population, borderline significance was noted between RARRES2 polymorphisms and chemerin levels, whereas high chemerin levels were associated with obesity, female sex, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, current smoking, high platelet and leukocyte counts, anemia, impaired renal function, high C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, and multi-vessel disease. Kaplan&ndash;Meier survival curves indicated that the patients with high chemerin and CRP levels, but not those with RARRES2 polymorphisms, had a lower survival rate and higher combined cerebral and cardiovascular event rates. Combined chemerin and CRP levels further revealed a stepwise increase in poor clinical outcomes from low- to high-risk subgroups. In conclusion, rs3735167 is the lead RARRES2 polymorphism for chemerin levels in Taiwanese. Chemerin levels, but not the rs3735167 genotypes, predicted the long-term outcome of CAD, especially when combined with CRP levels.",

The manufacturing approach consists in laser melting of elemental powder mixture in a controlled atmosphere of varying relative pressure of protective argon gas, producing alloys of 14.2 wt.% Al and Ni content varying between 2 and 4 wt.%. All the fabricated alloys are found to have attained martensitic microstructures capable of SMA specific phase transformations in the temperature range from 85 to 192 &deg;C. Both gas pressure and content of Ni are found to affect the specific transformation temperatures, transformation enthalpies, and mechanical properties. In particular, increasing gas pressure suppresses the austenite to martensite transformation reducing microhardness. In conclusion, the selective laser melting (SLM) employed in this work is shown capable of producing high density Cu-Al-Ni SMA (porosity &asymp; 2%).",

            "abstract": "Previously, we established a microRNA (miRNA) expression signature in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) tissues using RNA sequencing and found significantly reduced expression of miR-204-5p. Here, we aimed to investigate the functional significance of miR-204-5p and to identify miR-204-5p target genes involved in PDAC pathogenesis. Cancer cell migration and invasion were significantly inhibited by ectopic expression of miR-204-5p in PDAC cells. Comprehensive gene expression analyses and in silico database searches revealed 25 putative targets regulated by miR-204-5p in PDAC cells. Among these target genes, high expression levels of RACGAP1, DHRS9, AP1S3, FOXC1, PRP11, RHBDL2 and MUC4 were significant predictors of a poor prognosis of patients with PDAC. In this study, we focused on RACGAP1 (Rac guanosine triphosphatase-activating protein 1) because its expression was most significantly predictive of PDAC pathogenesis (overall survival rate: p = 0.0000548; disease-free survival rate: p = 0.0014). Overexpression of RACGAP1 was detected in PDAC clinical specimens, and its expression enhanced the migration and invasion of PDAC cells. Moreover, downstream genes affected by RACGAP1 (e.g., MMP28, CEP55, CDK1, ANLN and S100A14) are involved in PDAC pathogenesis. Our strategy to identify antitumor miRNAs and their target genes will help elucidate the molecular pathogenesis of PDAC.",

Composite membranes were developed by depositing a thin selective layer composed of CS copolymers onto a commercially-available porous support based on aromatic polysulfonamide (UPM-20&reg;). The topography and morphology of the obtained materials were studied by atomic force microscopy (AFM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD). Thermal properties and stability were determined by coupled evolved gas analysis (EGA-MS). Transport properties were estimated in pervaporation dehydration of THF. The effect of operating parameters for the pervaporation dehydration of THF such as feed compositions and temperatures (295, 308 and 323 K) was evaluated. It was shown that CS modification with different vinyl monomers led to a difference in physical and transport properties. The composite membrane with the thin selective layer based on CS-PAN copolymer demonstrated optimal transport properties and exhibited the highest water content in the permeate with a reasonably high permeation flux.",

            "abstract": "Type 2 diabetes is associated with diabetic cognopathy. Anti-hyperglycemic sodium glucose transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors have shown promise in reducing cognitive impairment in mice with type 2 diabetes mellitus. We recently described marked ultrastructural (US) remodeling of the neurovascular unit (NVU) in type 2 diabetic db\/db female mice. Herein, we tested whether the SGLT-2 inhibitor, empagliflozin (EMPA), protects the NVU from abnormal remodeling in cortical gray and subcortical white matter. Ten-week-old female wild-type and db\/db mice were divided into lean controls (CKC, n = 3), untreated db\/db (DBC, n = 3), and EMPA-treated db\/db (DBE, n = 3). Empagliflozin was added to mouse chow to deliver 10 mg kg&minus;1 day&minus;1 and fed for ten weeks, initiated at 10 weeks of age. Brains from 20-week-old mice were immediately immersion fixed for transmission electron microscopic study. Compared to CKC, DBC exhibited US abnormalities characterized by mural endothelial cell tight and adherens junction attenuation and\/or loss, pericyte attenuation and\/or loss, basement membrane thickening, glia astrocyte activation with detachment and retraction from mural cells, microglia cell activation with aberrant mitochondria, and oligodendrocyte&ndash;myelin splitting, disarray, and axonal collapse. We conclude that these abnormalities in the NVU were prevented in DBE. Empagliflozin may provide neuroprotection in the diabetic brain.",

            "abstract": "With mining of seafloor massive sulfides (SMS) coming closer to reality, it is vital that we have a good understanding of the geochemistry of these occurrences and the potential toxicity impact associated with mining them. In this study, SMS samples from seven hydrothermal fields from various tectonic settings were investigated by in-situ microanalysis (electron microprobe (EMPA) and laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS)) to highlight the distribution of potentially-toxic trace elements (Cu, Zn, Pb, Mn, Cd, As, Sb, Co, Ni, Bi, Ag and Hg) within the deposits, their minerals and textures. We demonstrate that a combination of mineralogy, trace element composition and texture characterisation of SMS from various geotectonic settings, when considered along with our current knowledge of oxidation rates and galvanic coupling, can be used to predict potential toxicity of deposit types and individual samples and highlight which may be of environmental concern. Although we cannot quantify toxicity, we observe that arc-related sulfide deposits have a high potential toxicity when compared with deposits from other tectonic settings based on their genetic association of a wide range of potentially toxic metals (As, Sb, Pb, Hg, Ag and Bi) that are incorporated into more reactive sulfosalts, galena and Fe-rich sphalerite. Thus, deposits such as these require special care when considered as mining targets. In contrast, the exclusive concern of ultra-mafic deposits is Cu, present in abundant, albeit less reactive chalcopyrite, but largely barren of other metals such as As, Pb, Sb, Cd and Hg. Whilst geological setting does dictate metal endowment, ultimately mineralogy is the largest control of trace element distribution and subsequent potential toxicity. Deposits containing abundant pyrrhotite (high-temperature deposits) and Fe-rich sphalerite (ubiquitous to all SMS deposits) as well as deposits with abundant colloform textures also pose a higher risk. This type of study can be combined with &ldquo;bulk lethal toxicity&rdquo; assessments and used throughout the stages of a mining project to help guide prospecting and legislation, focus exploitation and minimise environmental impact.",

This new consensus matrix has shown significantly better behaviour with regards to consistency than other group consensus matrices, but it is slightly worse in terms of compatibility, understood as the discrepancy between the individual positions and the collective position that synthesises them. This paper includes an iterative algorithm for improving the compatibility of the PCCM. The sequence followed to modify the judgments of the PCCM is given by the entries that most contribute to the overall compatibility of the group. The procedure is illustrated by means of its application to a real-life situation (a local context) with three decision makers and four alternatives. The paper also offers, for the first time in the scientific literature, a detailed explanation of the process followed to solve the optimisation problem proposed for the consideration of different weights for the decision makers in the calculation of the PCCM.",

            "abstract": "In this article, I approach the relationship between the ethical and political in Levinas from the perspective of the hermeneutic strategy he employs when engaging with political thought. I argue that, in two key texts&mdash;&ldquo;Reflections on the Philosophy of Hitlerism&rdquo; and Humanism of the Other&mdash;Levinas situates seemingly opposed traditions of political thought in chiastic relation to one another: liberalism and fascism, and humanism and antihumanism, respectively. Furthermore, I argue that Levinas&rsquo;s views on the relationship between the ethical and political in Otherwise than Being can be read as a response to the chiasmi found in the above texts. The relationship between the ontologies of liberalism and fascism is chiastic, because the latter&rsquo;s fatal embrace of embodied and historical existence relies on the dualism the former establishes between the subject as transcendent and the body as immanent. Humanism and antihumanism are in chiastic relation in terms of the question of violence. The latter critiques the former for the violence of its Platonist devaluation of historical cultures, and argues instead for the equivalence of cultures; however, in locating intelligibility in structures of which specific cultures are merely configurations, antihumanism repeats the devaluation of specific cultures. In an altered manner, it is, therefore, also a potentially violent view of intercultural relations. Levinas&rsquo;s analysis of sensible proximity to the human other is an attempt to account for the gravity of culturally situated meaning without turning it into an irrevocable fatality. I argue that the ethical does not detract from the situatedness of intelligibility, but demonstrates that we are bound to our cultural situation, not by fate, but by responsibility.",

            "abstract": "Melatonin (MT; N-acetyl-5-methoxytryptamine) is a pleiotropic signaling molecule that has been demonstrated to play an important role in plant growth, development, and regulation of environmental stress responses. Studies have been conducted on the role of the exogenous application of MT in a few species, but the potential mechanisms of MT-mediated stress tolerance under salt stress are still largely unknown. In this study, naked oat seedlings under salt stress (150 mM NaCl) were pretreated with two different concentrations of MT (50 and 100 &mu;M), and the effects of MT on the growth and antioxidant capacity of naked oat seedlings were analyzed to explore the regulatory effect of MT on salt tolerance. The results showed that pretreating with different concentrations of MT promoted the growth of seedlings in response to 150 mM NaCl. Different concentrations of MT reduced hydrogen peroxide, superoxide anion, and malondialdehyde contents. The exogenous application of MT also increased superoxide dismutase, peroxidase, catalase, and ascorbate peroxide activities. Chlorophyll content, leaf area, leaf volume, and proline increased in the leaves of naked oat seedlings under 150 mM NaCl stress. MT upregulated the expression levels of the lipid peroxidase genes lipoxygenase and peroxygenase, a chlorophyll biosynthase gene (ChlG), the mitogen-activated protein kinase genes Asmap1 and Aspk11, and the transcription factor genes (except DREB2), NAC, WRKY1, WRKY3, and MYB in salt-exposed MT-pretreated seedlings when compared with seedlings exposed to salt stress alone. These results demonstrate an important role of MT in the relief of salt stress and, therefore, provide a reference for managing salinity in naked oat.",

            "abstract": "Lignocellulose is a widely used renewable energy source on the Earth that is rich in carbon skeletons. The catalytic hydrolysis of lignocellulose over magnetic solid acid is an efficient pathway for the conversion of biomass into fuels and chemicals. In this study, a bamboo-derived carbonaceous magnetic solid acid catalyst was synthesized by FeCl3 impregnation, followed by carbonization and &ndash;SO3H group functionalization. The prepared catalyst was further subjected as the solid acid catalyst for the catalytic conversion of corncob polysaccharides into reducing sugars. The results showed that the as-prepared magnetic solid acid contained &ndash;SO3H, &ndash;COOH, and polycyclic aromatic, and presented good catalytic performance for the hydrolysis of corncob in the aqueous phase. The concentration of H+ was in the range of 0.6487 to 2.3204 mmol\/g. Dilute acid and alkali pretreatments of raw material can greatly improve the catalytic activity of bamboo-derived carbonaceous magnetic solid acid. Using the catalyst prepared by 0.25% H2SO4-pretreated bamboo, 6417.5 mg\/L of reducing sugars corresponding to 37.17% carbohydrates conversion could be obtained under the reaction conditions of 120 &deg;C for 30 min.",

            "abstract": "Sustainable production systems have become a relevant issue for consumers in the wine industry. Several studies have revealed that consumers are increasingly interested in organic wine and have attempted to estimate the price premium that consumers would have to pay for this &lsquo;new&rsquo; product. The aim of this paper is to assess the role of organic attributes in driving consumer choice, and how consumer socio-demographic characteristics influence the price premium for organic wine. An on-line survey was administrated among Italian wine consumers (N = 317) and an ordinal logistic regression model, based on cumulative probability distribution, was estimated. The results show important differences in the Willingness to Pay (WTP) between different market segments. Younger people have a more positive attitude towards wine with sustainable characteristics, and we found that consumers aged under 50 have a higher WTP. Price is another attribute that affects preferences for organic wine: consumers that state that price is a very important factor in the choice of a bottle are less willing to pay for organic wine. Consumers characterized by a low consumption frequency have a higher WTP for organic wine.",

The server adapts to the system size by using a strategy where the service provided can be either single or bulk depending on some threshold level c. If the number of customers in the system is less than c, then the server provides service to one customer at a time. If the number of customers in the system is greater than or equal to c, then the server provides service to a group of c customers. The service times are exponential and the service rates of single and bulk service are different. While providing service to either a single or a group of customers, the server may break down and goes through a repair phase. The breakdowns follow a Poisson distribution and the breakdown rates during single and bulk service are different. Also, repair times are exponential and repair rates during single and bulk service are different. The probability generating function and linear operator approaches are used to derive the system size steady-state probabilities.",

            "abstract": "Air-breathing marine predators must balance the conflicting demands of oxygen conservation during breath-hold and the cost of diving and locomotion to capture prey. However, it remains poorly understood how predators modulate foraging performance when feeding at different depths and in response to changes in prey distribution and type. Here, we used high-resolution multi-sensor tags attached to Risso's dolphins (Grampus griseus) and concurrent prey surveys to quantify their foraging performance over a range of depths and prey types. Dolphins (N = 33) foraged in shallow and deep habitats [seabed depths less or more than 560 m, respectively] and within the deep habitat, in vertically stratified prey features occurring at several aggregation levels. Generalized linear mixed-effects models indicated that dive kinematics were driven by foraging depth rather than habitat. Bottom-phase duration and number of buzzes (attempts to capture prey) per dive increased with depth. In deep dives, dolphins were gliding for &gt;50% of descent and adopted higher pitch angles both during descent and ascents, which was likely to reduce energetic cost of longer transits. This lower cost of transit was counteracted by the record of highest vertical swim speeds, rolling maneuvers and stroke rates at depth, together with a 4-fold increase in the inter-buzz interval (IBI), suggesting higher costs of pursuing, and handling prey compared to shallow-water feeding. In spite of the increased capture effort at depth, dolphins managed to keep their estimated overall metabolic rate comparable across dive types. This indicates that adjustments in swimming modes may enable energy balance in deeper dives. If we think of the surface as a central place where divers return to breathe, our data match predictions that central place foragers should increase the number and likely quality of prey items at greater distances. These dolphins forage efficiently from near-shore benthic communities to depth-stratified scattering layers, enabling them to maximize their fitness.",

            "abstract": "Dispersal is fundamental to population dynamics. However, it is increasingly apparent that, despite most models treating dispersal as a constant, many organisms make dispersal decisions based upon information gathered from the environment. Ideally, organisms would make fully informed decisions, with knowledge of both intra-patch conditions (conditions in their current location) and extra-patch conditions (conditions in alternative locations). Acquiring information is energetically costly, however, and extra-patch information will typically be costlier to obtain than intra-patch information. As a consequence, theory suggests that organisms will often make partially informed dispersal decisions, utilising intra-patch information only. We test this proposition in an experimental two-patch system using populations of the aquatic crustacean, Daphnia carinata. We manipulated conditions (food availability) in the population\u2019s home patch, and in its alternative patch. We found that D. carinata made use of intra-patch information (resource availability in the home patch induced a 10-fold increase in dispersal probability) but either ignored or were incapable of using of extra-patch information (resource availability in the alternative patch did not affect dispersal probability). We also observed a small apparent increase in dispersal in replicates with higher population densities, but this effect was smaller than the effect of resource constraint, and not found to be significant. Our work highlights the considerable influence that information can have on dispersal probability, but also that dispersal decisions will often be made in only a partially informed manner. The magnitude of the response we observed also adds to the growing chorus that condition-dependence may be a significant driver of variation in dispersal.",

At the molecular level, the disorder results from t(9;22)(q34;q11) reciprocal translocation between chromosomes, which leads to the formation of an oncogenic BCR&ndash;ABL gene fusion. Instead of progress in the understanding of the molecular etiology of CML and the development of novel therapeutic strategies, clinicians still face many challenges in the effective treatment of patients. In this review, we discuss the pathways of diagnosis and treatment of patients, as well as the problems appearing in the course of disease development. We also briefly refer to several aspects regarding the current knowledge on the molecular basis of CML and new potential therapeutic targets.

China  *These authors contributed equally to this work  Introduction: Poor prognosis of gastric cancer (GC) has partly been a result of late diagnosis due to nonspecific symptoms in the early stages. The overall survival rate of patients with GC is quite low. Here, we presented the functional role and potential mechanism of long noncoding RNA STXBP5-AS1 in GC. Materials and methods: CCK-8, scratch wound healing and Transwell assays were conducted to analyze proliferation, migration, and invasion of SGC7901 and MKN45 cells. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and Western blot assays were performed to investigate the relationship between STXBP5-AS1 and STXBP5. Finally, the correlation between STXBP5-AS1 and phosphorylated AKT1 (p-AKT1) was explored to reveal the potential mechanism of STXBP5-AS1 in GC. Western blot assays were performed to analyze phosphorylated AKT1 (p-AKT1) and AKT levels. Results: Our results suggested that STXBP5-AS1 suppressed proliferation, migration, and invasion, and the upregulation of STXBP5-AS1 significantly repressed STXBP5 expression, and knockdown of STXBP5-AS1 promoted STXBP5 expression. In addition, the p-AKT1 level decreased when STXBP5-AS1 was overexpressed and the p-AKT1 level increased with STXBP5-AS1 knockdown in SGC7901 and MKN45 cells. Conclusion: In summary, our results indicate that STXBP5-AS1 inhibits cell proliferation, migration, and invasion through PI3K\/AKT in GC.

Ingrassia&rdquo;, University of Catania, Catania, Italy Abstract: Iatrogenic bile duct injuries (BDIs) after laparoscopic cholecystectomy, being one of the most common performed surgical procedures, remain a substantial problem in gastrointestinal surgery with a significant impact on patient&rsquo;s quality of life. The primary aim of this review was to discuss the classification of BDIs, the proposed methods to prevent biliary lesions, the associated risk factors, and the management challenges depending on the timing of recognition of the injury, its extension, the patient&rsquo;s clinical condition, and the availability of experienced hepatobiliary surgeons. Early recognition of BDI is of paramount importance and limiting the diagnosis delay is crucial for an optimal postoperative outcome. The therapeutic management depends on the type and gravity of the biliary lesion, and includes endoscopic, radiologic, and surgical approaches.

Opiates and weaker analgesics, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), are not sufficiently effective in achieving control of severe pain and might cause respiratory and gastrointestinal complications. In the past decade, there has been an increased interest in the use of regional nerve blocks for post-thoracoscopy and post-thoracotomy analgesia. Methods: This is a prospective, randomized, double-blind and single-center study. We recruited 104 patients who underwent elective thoracoscopy. Prior to surgery, the participating patients were randomized into one of two study groups: Group 1- the &ldquo;standard control group&rdquo; that received standard postoperative pain control with intravenous opioids, NSAIDs and acetaminophen (paracetamol) and Group 2- the &ldquo;block group&rdquo; that was treated by ultrasound-guided serratus anterior plane (SAP) block (a single injection of 0.25% bupivacaine hydrochloride 2 mg\/kg plus dexamethasone 8 mg) with standard postoperative pain control regimen. We compared the clinical, laboratory, and postoperative pain assessment data of both groups. Results: Patients in the SAP block Group 2 reported significantly lower levels of pain after thoracic surgery as assessed by their visual analog scale scores, as compared to the patients in the standard pain control Group 1 (P&lt;0.001). The total dosage of morphine and tramadol required for pain relief during the first hours after surgery was significantly lower in the patients who received SAP block. Also, the incidence of vomiting after surgery was significantly lower among the patients who received SAP block than among the patients who received standard pain control. Conclusion: The results of the present study suggest that SAP block is an effective adjuvant treatment option for post-thoracic surgery analgesia. Compared to the current methods used for post-thoracic surgery pain relief, SAP block has some significant merits, particularly its ease of use and its low potential for side effects.

MACC1 was reported to be associated with tumor progression. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the expression and role of MACC1 in cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) and its correlation with angiogenesis. Patients and methods: We investigated the expression and correlation of MACC1 and VEGFA in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) datasets and in 7 paired frozen CCA and matched paracarcinoma tissues. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was used to examine MACC1 and VEGFA expression as well as microvessel density (MVD) in 122 paraffin-embedded CCA samples. Western blotting, real-time qPCR and ELISA were performed to investigate the effect of MACC1 knockdown on VEGFA expression and secretion in CCA cells. Subsequently, we collected conditioned medium from cells with MACC1 knockdown and used it in angiogenesis assays. Results: The expression levels of both MACC1 and VEGFA were significantly upregulated in the TCGA and GEO datasets and in the 7 paired frozen CCA tissues compared to the matched paracarcinoma tissues, and MACC1 was significantly correlated with VEGFA. IHC showed that high expression of MACC1 and VEGFA was significantly correlated with lymph node metastasis (P&lt;0.05 and P&lt;0.01) and worse survival (P&lt;0.01, P&lt;0.05) in patients with CCA.&nbsp;We further verified that MACC1 was significantly correlated with VEGFA (P&lt;0.01) and MVD&nbsp;(P&lt;0.01) in clinical samples. Western blotting, real-time qPCR and ELISA results showed that&nbsp;MACC1 knockdown in CCA cells significantly decreased the protein and mRNA expression of&nbsp;VEGFA and reduced the VEGFA concentration in conditioned medium. Moreover, angiogenesis&nbsp;assays showed that conditioned medium from CCA cells with MACC1 knockdown decreased&nbsp;the number of tubes formed.&nbsp; Conclusion: Our results indicate that MACC1 and VEGFA expression are upregulated in CCA. Moreover, MACC1 is an independent predictor of overall survival and facilitates angiogenesis in CCA by upregulating of VEGFA.  Keywords: microvessel density, TCGA, GEO, prognosis, carcinoma",

            "abstract": "\nCervical esophageal cancer (CEC) is uncommon, accounting for less than 5% of all esophageal cancers. The management of CEC is controversial. This study investigated treatment outcomes and prognostic factors of survival in CEC patients undergoing definitive radiotherapy or concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT). Ninety-one CEC patients were treated by intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) and three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy (3DCRT) between July 2007 and September 2017. The mean prescription dose was 64 Gy (range 54-70 Gy) delivered as 1.8-2.2 Gy per fraction per day, 5 days a week. Out of 91 patients, 34 received concurrent cisplatin-based chemotherapy (CT) including 18 patients who also received neoadjuvant CT. Overall survival (OS), locoregional failure-free survival (LRFFS), and progression-free survival (PFS) were estimated by the Kaplan\u2013Meier method. Prognostic factors of survival were determined in univariate (log-rank test) and multivariate (Cox proportional hazard model) analysis. Treatment-related toxicity was also assessed. Median follow-up time for all patients was 19 months. Two-year OS, LRFFS and PFS of all patients were 58.2%, 52.5% and 48.1%, respectively. Clinical stage was an independent prognostic factor for OS (HR = 2.35, 95% CI: 1.03-5.37, p = 0.042), LRFFS (HR = 3.84, 95% CI: 1.38-10.69, p = 0.011), and PFS (HR = 2.68, 95% CI: 1.11-6.45, p = 0.028). Hoarseness was an independent prognostic factor for OS (HR = 2.10, 95% CI: 1.05-4.19, p = 0.036). CCRT was independently associated with better LRFFS (HR = 0.33, 95% CI: 0.14-0.79, p = 0.012). 3DCRT and IMRT with concurrent CT is well-tolerated and may improve local tumor control in CEC patients. Advanced clinical stage and hoarseness are adverse prognostic factors for OS, LRFFS, and PFS in CEC.\n",

The analysis of a sample of 2,039 news items, published between the months of March to November 2017, shows that there is a correlation between the content of the news and the level of engagement that they create among users. Although the sites presented a greater amount of news on issues of non-public issues, such as sports, police or entertainment, the highest levels of engagement were recorded in news on public issues, such as national and international policy and economy. These findings are consistent with the literature on the process of adaptation of the media to the new media ecosystem and support the theory of \u201cmonitorial citizenship\u201d in the digital context.",

The findings were obtained in these analyzes and synthesized within the framework of the meta -synthesis\r\nresearch method, and the meta-synthesis studies were conducted in the context of the determined themes.\r\nResults: The common aspects of all the studies involved in meta-synthesis are that the democratic parental\r\nattitudes are achieved in a way that positively affects children\u2019s social skills and that other parental attitudes are\r\nadversely affected. Together with the studies indicating that there is a low level of relationship between\r\nbehavioral problems and parental attitudes and that there is no relationship, when the sub -dimensions of the\r\nstudies are examined, it is seen that the attitudes of the parents are influential on the behaviors of the children.\r\nConclusion: Parental involvement has a significant influence on the children\u2019s social development and behavior,\r\nand there are many variables that affect the relationship between the child and the parent.",

            "abstract": "Objective: This study aimed to measure the anthelmintic effects of betel nut (Areca catechu) and neem (Azadirachta indica) leaf extracts against Fasciola spp. in vitro in comparison with the com-mercial dewormer, Albendazole, and the negative control, nutrient broth. The study determined the extract concentration that produced the highest efficacy based on the average recorded mean motility time, gross, and microscopic changes of the flukes treated with different concentrations of plant extracts.\nMaterial and Methods: The study consisted of eight treatments. Every treatment consisted of 10%, 20%, and 40% concentrations of both betel nut extract (BNE) and neem leaf extracts, positive control treatment (Albendazole-treated) and negative control treatment (25 ml nutrient broth). The motility of the flukes on all treatments was based on the established motility criteria scoring. The flukes subjected to all treatments were processed for histopathological analysis.\nResults: The result of the study revealed that after exposure of Fasciola spp. under 10%, 20%, and 40% extract concentrations, betel nut showed higher efficacy having the recorded mean motility time of 0.22, 0.07 min, and no movement upon contact, respectively, than Albendazole which produced mean motility time of 0.38 min. Nevertheless, the flukes treated with 10%, 20%, and 40% neem leaf extracts obtained the average mean motility time of 220, 151, and 98 min, respectively.\nConclusions: The results gathered showed that 40% BNE concentration showed the highest efficacy based on the recorded mean motility time. All treatments of betel nut extract evidently showed marked changes in the gross and microscopic morphology of the flukes. However, the neem extract was ineffective in all concentrations although changes were observed microscopically. Furthermore, the nutrient broth was proven to be effective as a culture medium since the flukes remained active until 8 h of exposure. [J Adv Vet Anim Res 2019; 6(1.000): 44-49]",

A cross-sectional study was conducted to determine the prevalence of Gastro-intestinal (GI) parasites of dromedary camel (Camelus dromedarius) and fat-tailed sheep (dhumba), and the prevalence of hemoparasites in camel from Dhaka, Bangladesh.\nMaterials and Methods: A total of 87 fecal samples (32 dhumba and 55 camel) and 55 camel blood samples were collected during September\u0096October 2015. Fecal samples were examined by direct smear, sedimentation method, flotation technique, and McMaster technique for GI parasite. Giemsa stained blood smears were examined under microscope for hemoparasite detection.\nResults: 62% camel (n = 34; 95% confidence interval (CI): 47.7\u009674.6) were infected with at least one genus of parasite. 15% camel were harboring more than one genus of parasite. The prevalence of GI parasite and hemoparasite in camel were recorded as Trichuris spp. (n = 16; 29%; 95% CI: 17.6\u009642.9), Balantidium coli (n = 12; 22%; 95% CI: 11.8\u009635.0), Trichostrongylus spp. (n = 7; 13%; 95% CI: 5.3\u009624.5), Strongyloides spp. (n = 5; 9%; 95% CI: 3.0\u009620.0), Anaplasma spp. (n = 5; 9%; 95% CI: 3.02\u009620.0), Paragonimus spp. (n = 1; 2%; 95% CI: 0.05\u00969.7), Schistosoma spp. (n = 1; 2%; 95% CI: 0.05\u00969.7), Hymenolepis spp. (n = 1; 2%; 95% CI: 0.05\u00969.7), Moniezia spp. (n = 1; 2%; 95% CI: 0.05\u00969.7), and Babesia spp. (n = 1; 2%; 95% CI: 0.05\u00969.7). Mean EPG feces of camel was 291.76 \u00b1 42.03 with a range of 0\u00961,400. Total 59.4% dhumba (n = 19; 95% CI: 41\u009676) were positive for GI parasite, including Trichostrongylus spp. (n = 10; 31.3%; 95% CI: 16.1\u009650), Strongyloides spp. (n = 9; 28%; 95% CI: 13.8\u009646.8), B. coli(n = 5; 15.6%; 95% CI: 5.3\u009632.8), and Trichuris spp. (n = 4; 12.5%; 95% CI: 3.5\u009628.9).\nConclusions: High percentage of parasitic infestation in camel and dhumba in the present study refers to the necessity of use of anthelmintic for health and production improvement and to prevent zoonotic parasite transmission to animal handler and workers.

            "abstract": "Abstract Background In developing countries, malaria diagnosis relies on microscopy and rapid diagnostic tests. In Senegal, national malaria control program (NMCP) regularly conducts supervisory visits in health services where malaria microscopy is performed. In this study, expert microscopists assessed the performance of laboratory technicians in malaria microscopy. Methods The present external quality assessment (EQA) was conducted in three different areas of malaria transmission. Participants were laboratory technicians previously trained by NMCP on malaria microscopy. Stored read slides were randomly collected for blinded re-checking by expert microscopists. At the same time a set of 8 slides (3 positive P. falciparum and 5 negative slides) were submitted to participants for proficiency testing. Microscopists performance were evaluated on the basis of the errors rates on slide reading\u2014high false positive (HFP), high false negative (HFN), low false positive (LFP) and low false negative (LFN)\u2014and the calculation of their sensitivities and specificities relative to expert microscopy. Data were entered and analysed using Microsoft Excel software. Results A total of 450 stored slides were collected from 17 laboratories for re-checking. Eight laboratories scored 100% of correct reading. Only one major error was recorded (HFP). Six laboratories recorded LFN results: Borrelia, P. ovale, and low parasite densities (95 and 155\u00a0p\/\u03bcl) were missed. Two P. falciparum slides were misidentified as P. malariae and one P. ovale slide as P. vivax. The overall sensitivities and specificities for all participants against expert microscopists were 97.8 and 98.2% respectively; Sensitivities and specificities of hospital microscopists (96.7 and 98.9%) were statistically similar to those of health centre microscopists (98.5 and 97.8% respectively) (p\u2009=\u20090.3993 and p\u2009=\u20090.9412 respectively). Overall, a very good agreement was noted with kappa value of 0.96 (CI95% 93.4\u201398.6%) relative to expert microscopy. Proficiency testing showed that among the 17 participants, 11 laboratories scored 100% of correct reading. Three LFN and four LFP results were recorded respectively. The P. falciparum slide with Maurer dots was misidentified as P. ovale in 1 centre and the same slide was misread as P. vivax in another centre; No major error (HFP or HFN) was noted. Conclusion EQA of malaria microscopy showed an overall good performance especially regarding P. falciparum detection. However, efforts need to be made addressing the ability to detect non-falciparum species and others endemic blood pathogens such as Borrelia. The further NMCP training sessions and evaluations should consider those aspects to expect high quality-assured capacity for malaria microscopy.",

            "abstract": "Abstract Background Corn stover (CS) is an abundant source of feed for livestock in China. However, it is low in nutritional value that we have been seeking technologies to improve. Previous studies show that non-fiber carbohydrate (NFC) might limit the utilization of a CS diet by lactating dairy cows. Thus, this study was conducted to investigate the lactation performance and rumen fermentation characteristics in lactating cows consuming CS with two contents of NFC compared to an alfalfa hay-containing diet. Twelve Holstein cows were used in a replicated 3\u2009\u00d7\u20093 Latin square design with three dietary treatments: (1) low-NFC diet (NFC\u2009=\u200935.6%, L-NFC), (2) high-NFC diet (NFC\u2009=\u200940.1%, H-NFC), and (3) alfalfa hay diet (NFC\u2009=\u200938.9%, AH). Results Intake of DM was lower for cows fed H-NFC compared to L-NFC and AH, while the milk yield was higher in AH than in H-NFC and L-NFC (P\u2009<\u20090.01). The feed efficiency (milk yield\/DM intake, 1.15 vs. 1.08, P\u2009<\u20090.01) were greater for cows fed H-NFC than L-NFC. The contents of milk protein and lactose were not different among the groups (P\u2009>\u20090.11), but milk fat content was higher for cows fed H-NFC and L-NFC compared to AH (P\u2009<\u20090.01). The rumen ammonia nitrogen concentration and the concentrations of urea nitrogen in blood and milk were lower for cows fed H-NFC and AH compared to L-NFC (P\u2009<\u20090.05). The concentrations of rumen propionate and total volatile fatty acids were different among groups (P\u2009<\u20090.05) with higher concentration for cows fed AH compared to H-NFC and L-NFC, and acetate concentration tended to be different among groups (P\u2009=\u20090.06). Conclusions From the results obtained in this study, it was inferred that the increased NFC content in a diet containing corn stover can improve the feed efficiency and benefit the nitrogen conversion.",

These parameters are used together with the world-average value of the B s 0 mixing phase, \u22122\u03b2 s , to obtain a measurement of the CKM angle \u03b3 from B s 0 \u2009\u2192\u2009D s \u2213 K \u00b1 decays, yielding \u03b3\u2009=\u2009(128 \u2212\u200922 +\u200917 )\u00b0 modulo 180\u00b0, where the uncertainty contains both statistical and systematic contributions.

The K S 0 \u2009\u2212\u2009K L 0 asymmetry can be used to search for two-body doubly Cabibbo-suppressed amplitudes of charm-baryon decays, with the one in \u039b c + \u2009\u2192\u2009pK S,L 0 as a promising observable. Besides, it is studied for a new CP-violation effect in these processes, induced by the interference between the Cabibbo-favored and doubly Cabibbo-suppressed amplitudes with the neutral kaon mixing. Once the new CP-violation effect is determined by experiments, the direct CP asymmetry in neutral kaon modes can then be extracted and used to search for new physics. The numerical results based on SU(3) symmetry will be tested by the experiments in the future.",

We point out that a commonly used prescription for calculating this quantity leads to a temperature dependence in conflict with general properties of the free energy. The problem originates from a particular way of subtracting divergences. We argue that the commonly used prescription gives rise to the binding energy rather than the free energy. We consider a different subtraction procedure and show that the resulting free energy is well-behaved and in qualitative agreement with results from lattice QCD. The free energy and the binding energy of the quark pair are computed for N = 4 $$ \\mathcal{N}=4 $$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory and several non-conformal theories. We also calculate the entropy and the internal energy of the pair in these theories. Using the consistent subtraction, we further study the free energy, entropy, and internal energy of a single heavy quark in the thermal medium for various theories. Also here the results are found to be in qualitative agreement with lattice QCD results.",

            "abstract": "Abstract Background There is a need to build the evidence base of early interventions to promote children\u2019s health and development in the UK. Chance UK is a voluntary sector organisation based in London that delivers a 12-month mentoring programme for primary school children identified by teachers and parents as having behavioural and emotional difficulties. The aim of the study is to determine the effectiveness of the programme in terms of children\u2019s behaviour and emotional well-being; this is the primary outcome of the trial. Methods\/Design A randomised controlled trial will be conducted in which participants are randomly allocated on a dynamic basis to one of two possible arms: the intervention arm (n\u2009=\u2009123) will be offered the mentoring programme, and the control arm (n\u2009=\u2009123) will be offered services as usual. Outcome data will be collected at three points: pre-intervention (baseline), mid-way through the mentoring year (c.9\u00a0months after randomisation) and post- mentoring programme (c.16\u00a0months after randomisation). Discussion This study will further enhance the evidence for early intervention mentoring programmes for child behaviour and emotional well-being in the UK.

We identify a geometric charge for these configurations and show that it is interchanged with the H-flux under T-duality. We furthermore perform a supersymmetry analysis and find that T-duality can break supersymmetry, in agreement with earlier results in the literature. We contrast our findings to compactifications of the NS5-brane on tori, which have vanishing geometric charge and for which T-duality transformations along the compact directions preserve supersymmetry. This shows that the uncompactified NS5-brane and the compactified-and-smeared solution have different properties and behave differently under T-duality.",

            "abstract": "Abstract It is natural to expect a consistent inflationary model of the very early Universe to be an effective theory of quantum gravity, at least at energies much less than the Planck one. For the moment, R + R 2, or shortly R 2, inflation is the most successful in accounting for the latest CMB data from the PLANCK satellite and other experiments. Moreover, recently it was shown to be ultra-violet (UV) complete via an embedding into an analytic infinite derivative (AID) non-local gravity. In this paper, we derive a most general theory of gravity that contributes to perturbed linear equations of motion around maximally symmetric space-times. We show that such a theory is quadratic in the Ricci scalar and the Weyl tensor with AID operators along with the Einstein-Hilbert term and possibly a cosmological constant. We explicitly demonstrate that introduction of the Ricci tensor squared term is redundant. Working in this quadratic AID gravity framework without a cosmological term we prove that for a specified class of space homogeneous space-times, a space of solutions to the equations of motion is identical to the space of backgrounds in a local R 2 model. We further compute the full second order perturbed action around any background belonging to that class. We proceed by extracting the key inflationary parameters of our model such as a spectral index (n s ), a tensor-to-scalar ratio (r) and a tensor tilt (n t ). It appears that n s remains the same as in the local R 2 inflation in the leading slow-roll approximation, while r and n t get modified due to modification of the tensor power spectrum. This class of models allows for any value of r < 0.07 with a modified consistency relation which can be fixed by future observations of primordial B-modes of the CMB polarization. This makes the UV complete R 2 gravity a natural target for future CMB probes.",

            "abstract": "Abstract Minimal scenarios with light (sub-GeV) dark matter whose relic density is obtained from thermal freeze-out must include new light mediators. In particular, a very well-motivated case is that of a new \u201cdark\u201d massive vector gauge boson mediator. The mass term for such mediator is most naturally obtained by a \u201cdark Higgs mechanism\u201d which leads to the presence of an often long-lived dark Higgs boson whose mass scale is the same as that of the mediator. We study the phenomenology and experimental constraints on two minimal, self-consistent dark sectors that include such a light dark Higgs boson. In one the dark matter is a pseudo-Dirac fermion, in the other a complex scalar. We find that the constraints from BBN and CMB are considerably relaxed in the framework of such minimal dark sectors. We present detection prospects for the dark Higgs boson in existing and projected proton beam-dump experiments. We show that future searches at experiments like Xenon1T or LDMX can probe all the relevant parameter space, complementing the various upcoming indirect constraints from astrophysical observations.",

            "abstract": "Abstract Background Despite the existence of proven solutions to improve maternal health, innovative approaches are still necessary to support the implementation of programs and policies in real-world settings. To address this challenge, we developed a participatory capacity strengthening model based on Communities of Practice (CoPs) of maternal health frontline personnel and decision-makers involved in implementing maternal health programs in Latin America. The activities focused on the conduct and use of implementation research to enhance maternal health decision-making. Our objective is to evaluate the performance of the Communities of Practice in using implementation research to support decision-making in maternal health programs in Mexico and Nicaragua. Methods We evaluated the CoPs\u2019 performance using a mixed methods approach. We appraised the performance of CoPs using five criteria: (i) integration of the CoP, (ii) ownership of the methodology, (iii) timely delivery of products, (iv) feedback to decision-makers, and (v) influence on program changes. We also included an assessment of the barriers and facilitators to the conduct and uptake of implementation research findings in maternal health decision-making. Results Two CoPs showed \u201csub-optimal\u201d performance, one was signaled as \u201cneeding strengthening,\u201d and three reached \u201coptimal\u201d performance in the use of implementation research to enhance maternal health programs. The relationships between champions, facilitators, and research team were the main internal enabling factor for success. Externally, political and epidemiological environments acted as the main barriers to the performance of CoPs. Conclusions Our study highlights the value of involving decision-makers in CoPs, ensuring varied skill sets and profiles of health professionals, as well as maintaining strong and continuous collaborations with researchers. Collaborative approaches and meaningful engagement of decision-makers and researchers are useful in conducting implementation research and promoting the use of evidence to improve maternal health programs in resource-strained settings.",

To date, however, much of the literature has focused on direct service provider perspectives on EBP implementation. The aim of this mixed-method study was to identify factors associated with the sustainment of multiple EBPs within a system-driven implementation effort in children\u2019s mental health services. Methods Data were gathered from 186 leaders at 59 agencies within the Los Angeles County Department of Mental Health who were contracted to deliver one of six EBPs within the Prevention and Early Intervention initiative. Results Multi-level analyses of quantitative survey data (N\u00a0=\u2009186) revealed a greater probability of leader-reported EBP sustainment in large agencies and when leaders held more positive perceptions toward the EBP. Themes from semi-structured qualitative interviews conducted with a subset of survey participants (n\u00a0=\u200947) expanded quantitative findings by providing detail on facilitating conditions in larger agencies and aspects of EBP fit that were perceived to lead to greater sustainment, including perceived fit with client needs, implementation requirements, aspects of the organizational workforce, availability of trainings, and overall therapist attitudes about EBPs. Conclusions Findings inform EBP implementation efforts regarding decisions around organizational-level supports and promotion of EBP fit.",

            "abstract": "Abstract Background In Togo, about half of health care costs are paid at the point of service, which reduces access to health care and exposes households to catastrophic health expenditure (CHE). To address this situation, the Togolese government introduced a National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS) in 2011. This insurance currently covers only employees and retirees of the State as well as their dependents, although plans for extension exist. This study is the first attempt to examine the extent to which Togo\u2019s NHIS protects its members financially against the consequences of ill-health. Methods Data was obtained from a cross-sectional representative households\u2019 survey involving 1180 insured households that had reported illness in the household in the 4 weeks preceding the survey or hospitalization in the 12 months preceding the survey. The incidence and intensity of CHE were measured by the catastrophic health payment method. A logistic regression was used to analyse determinants of CHE. Results The results indicate that the proportion of insured households with CHE varies widely between 3.94% and 75.60%, depending on the method and the threshold used. At the 40% threshold, health care cost represents 60.95% of insured households\u2019 total monthly non-food expenditure. This study showed that the socioeconomic status, the type of health facility used, hospitalization and household size were the highest predictors of CHE. Whatever the chosen threshold, care in referral and district hospitals significantly increases the likelihood of CHE. In addition, the proportion of households facing CHE is higher in the lowest income groups. The behaviour of health care providers, poor quality of care and long waiting time were the main factors leading to CHE. Conclusion A sizable proportion of insured households face CHE, suggesting gaps in the coverage. To limit the impoverishment of insured households with low income, policies for free or heavily subsidized hospital services should be considered. The results call for an equitable health insurance scheme, which is affordable for all insured households.",

            "abstract": "Abstract Background Despite the potential population-level impact of a health-promoting schools approach, schools face challenges in implementation, indicating a gap between school health research and practice. Knowledge exchange provides an opportunity to reduce this gap; however, there has been limited evaluation of these initiatives. This research explored researchers\u2019 and knowledge users\u2019 perceptions of outcomes associated with a knowledge exchange initiative within COMPASS, a longitudinal study of Canadian secondary students and schools. Schools received annual tailored summaries of their students\u2019 health behaviours and suggestions for action and were linked with knowledge brokers to support them in taking action to improve student health. Methods Qualitative semi-structured interviews were conducted with COMPASS researchers (n\u2009=\u200913), school staff (n\u2009=\u200913), and public health stakeholders (n\u2009=\u20094) to explore their experiences with COMPASS knowledge exchange. Key issues included how knowledge users used school-specific findings, perceived outcomes of knowledge exchange, and suggestions for change. Results Outcomes for both knowledge users and researchers were identified; interestingly, knowledge users attributed more outcomes to using school-specific findings than knowledge brokering. School and public health participants indicated school-specific findings informed their programming and planning. Importantly, knowledge exchange provided a platform for partnerships between researchers, schools, and public health units. Knowledge brokering allowed researchers to gain feedback from knowledge users to enhance the study and a better understanding of the school environment. Interestingly, COMPASS knowledge exchange outcomes aligned with Samdal and Rowling\u2019s eight theory-driven implementation components for health-promoting schools. Hence, knowledge exchange may provide a mechanism to help schools implement a health-promoting schools approach. Conclusions This research contributes to the limited literature regarding outcomes of knowledge brokering in public health and knowledge exchange in school health research. However, since not all schools engaged in knowledge brokering, and not all schools that engaged discussed these outcomes, further research is needed to determine the amount of engagement required for change and examine the process of COMPASS knowledge brokering to consider how to increase school engagement.",

            "abstract": "Abstract Background Childhood obesity is emerging as a major public health problem worldwide. To date, most studies of obesity and overweight in Peru are focused on adults, with few of them involving\u00a0children, a population at a critical stage of development. The trend in overweight and obesity prevalence in Peruvian children under the age of five has not yet been determined. Thus, the\u00a0objective of the present study is to evaluate the prevalence rates of overweight and obesity between 2010 and 2015 in children under the age of five, stratified by geographical areas in Peru. Methods Data were obtained from the Nutritional Status Information System of Peru. The total number of children evaluated was 14,155,914. For the Geographic Information Systems (GIS), the\u00a0program Geo Da 1.8\u00ae was used\u00a0to ascertain the spatial distribution of prevalence rates and\u00a0was mapped for children under five. To assess the degree of spatial dependence, exploratory spatial data analysis was performed using the Moran\u2019s I statistic and was assessed with the Local Indicators of Spatial Association (LISA) analysis to identify geographic concentrations of high and low of obesity and overweight levels. Results Between 2010 and 2015, the national prevalence of childhood overweight and obesity ranged from 6.2%- 6.8% and 1.5%\u20132.7%, respectively. The highest prevalence of childhood overweight and obesity was found in 2014 and 2013, respectively. During these years, we observed that obesity decreased, but overweight remained stable. The highest prevalence of overweight and obesity was found in the departments located on the coast. Significant positive spatial autocorrelation was found for both overweight and obesity. The departments with\u00a0the highest prevalence of overweight and obesity were concentrated in Lima, Callao, Ica, Moquegua and Tacna. The lowest were found in Loreto, Cusco and San Martin. Conclusion The decrease in obesity and the stabilisation of overweight are\u00a0positive results for the Peruvian childhood. However, in comparison with other Latin American countries, Peru still lags in obesity prevention.",

            "abstract": "Abstract Background The prevalence of diabetes mellitus (DM) is reportedly growing fast in sub-Saharan Africa. There is however a scarcity of epidemiologic data on DM in Burkina Faso. We carried out a secondary analysis of the first survey conducted in Burkina Faso on a nationally representative sample following the World Health Organization (WHO) Stepwise approach to risk factors Surveillance (STEPS) for non-communicable diseases (NCDs) with the aims of identifying the prevalence of NCDs and the prevalence of common risk factors for NCDs. We report here on the prevalence of diabetes and overall abnormal glucose regulation (AGR) and their associated risk factors. Methods In the primary study 4800 individuals were randomly sampled using a stratified multistage clusters sampling process. We used fasting capillary whole blood glucose level to define three glucose regulation statuses using WHO\u2019s cut-off levels: normal, diabetes and overall abnormal glucose regulation (impaired fasting glucose and diabetes). Appropriate statistical techniques for the analysis of survey data were used to identify the factors associated with diabetes and abnormal glucose regulation fitting a logistic regression model. Analyses were carried out using Stata Version 14 software. Results The prevalence of DM and AGR were respectively 5.8% (95% CI: 5\u20136.7) and 9% (95% CI: 8\u201310.1). Significant risk factors for DM include age (OR\u2009=\u20091.9; P\u2009=\u20090.009 for the age group of 55\u201364), obesity (OR: 2.6; P\u2009=\u20090.001), former smoke (OR:2; P\u2009=\u20090.03), second-hand smoke (OR\u2009=\u20091.7; P\u2009=\u20090.006) and total cholesterol level (OR: 2.1; P\u2009=\u20090.024). The same predictors were also found significantly associated with AGR. In addition, having an history family diabetes was protective against AGR (OR\u2009=\u20090.5; P\u2009=\u20090.032). Conclusion Diabetes is no longer a rare disease in the adult active population of Burkina Faso. Its burden is significant in both rural and urban areas. Health policies that promote healthy life style are needed to give precedence to the prevention in a context of an under-resourced country.",

The objectives of this study were to evaluate the contribution of working conditions in the explanation of social inequalities in work injury in a national representative sample of employees. Methods The study was based on the cross-sectional sample of the national French survey SUMER 2010 including 46,962 employees, 26,883 men and 20,079 women. The number of work injuries within the last 12\u00a0months was studied as the outcome. Occupation was used as a marker of social position. Psychosocial work factors included various variables related to the classical job strain model, psychological demands, decision latitude, social support, and other understudied variables related to reward, job insecurity, job promotion, esteem, working time and hours and workplace violence. Occupational exposures of chemical, biological, physical and biomechanical nature were also studied. Weighted age-adjusted Poisson regression analyses were performed. Results Occupational gradients were observed in the exposure of most psychosocial work factors and occupational exposures. Strong occupational differences in work injury were found, blue-collar workers being more likely to have work injury. Chemical, biological, physical and biomechanical exposures contributed to explain the occupational differences in work injury substantially. Noise, thermic constraints, manual materials handling, postural\/articular constraints and vibrations had significant contributions. Psychosocial work factors also contributed to explain the differences especially among women. Conclusion Prevention policies oriented toward chemical, biological, physical, biomechanical and psychosocial work exposures may contribute to reduce the magnitude of occupational differences in work injury.",

            "abstract": "Abstract Background Schistosomes are blood dwelling parasitic worms that cause the debilitating disease schistosomiasis. Here we examined the influence of the parasites on their external environment by monitoring the impact of adult Schistosoma mansoni worms on the murine plasma proteome in vitro and, in particular, on how the worms affect the blood coagulation protein high molecular weight kininogen (HK). Methods Following the incubation of adult schistosomes in murine plasma, two-dimensional differential in-gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE) was conducted to look for changes in the plasma proteome compared with control plasma. A major change to the blood protein kininogen (HK) was observed, and the interaction of Schistosoma mansoni parasite with this protein alone was then investigated by western blot analysis and activity assays. Finally, the generation of bradykinin from HK was monitored using a bradykinin detection kit. Results The most striking change to the plasma proteome concerned HK; while the full-length protein was more abundant in control plasma, carboxyl-terminal truncated forms were more abundant in plasma that contained schistosomes. Incubating parasites in buffer with pure HK followed by Western blot analysis confirmed that human HK is degraded by the worms. The resulting digestion pattern differed from that brought about by kallikrein, a host serine protease that normally acts on HK to release the vasodilator bradykinin. We found that live schistosomes, while digesting HK, do not generate bradykinin nor do they cleave a chromogenic kallikrein substrate. Since the cleavage of HK by the worms is not impeded by the serine protease inhibitor PMSF but is blocked by the cysteine protease inhibitor E64c, we hypothesize that schistosome tegumental cysteine proteases are responsible for HK cleavage. Conclusions Since proteomic and biochemical studies have revealed that the schistosome tegument contains two cysteine proteases belonging to the calpain family (SmCalp1 and SmCalp2) we conclude that these are likely responsible for the HK cleavage reported here. Schistosome cleavage of HK should help impede blood clotting and inflammation around the worms in vivo and so promote their ease of movement within the vasculature of their hosts.",

            "abstract": "Coating of plasma chemical oxidized titanium (TiOB&reg;) with gentamicin-tannic acid (TiOB&reg; gta) has proven to be efficient in preventing bacterial colonization of implants. However, in times of increasing antibiotic resistance, the development of alternative antimicrobial functionalization strategies is of major interest. Therefore, the aim of the present study is to evaluate the antibacterial and biocompatible properties of TiOB&reg; functionalized with silver nanoparticles (TiOB&reg; SiOx Ag) and ionic zinc (TiOB&reg; Zn). Antibacterial efficiency was determined by agar diffusion and proliferation test on Staphylocuccus aureus. Cytocompatibility was analyzed by direct cultivation of MC3T3-E1 cells on top of the functionalized surfaces for 2 and 4 d. All functionalized surfaces showed significant bactericidal effects expressed by extended lag phases (TiOB&reg; gta for 5 h, TiOB&reg; SiOx Ag for 8 h, TiOB&reg; Zn for 10 h). While TiOB&reg; gta (positive control) and TiOB&reg; Zn remained bactericidal for 48 h, TiOB&reg; SiOx Ag was active for only 4 h. After direct cultivation for 4 d, viable MC3T3-E1 cells were found on all surfaces tested with the highest biocompatibility recorded for TiOB&reg; SiOx Ag. The present study revealed that functionalization of TiOB&reg; with ionic zinc shows bactericidal properties that are comparable to those of a gentamicin-containing coating.",

This Italian R&amp;D project is aimed at providing non-industrial active customers and prosumers with a monitoring and control device that would enable demand response through optimization of their own distributed energy resources (DERs). The optimal control of resources is organized with a hierarchical control structure and performed in two stages. A cloud-based computation platform provides global control functions based on model predictive control whereas a closed-loop local device manages actual monitoring and control of field components. In this architecture, load forecasts on a small scale (a single residential or tertiary building) are needed as inputs of the predictive control problem. The microforecasting module aimed at providing such inputs was designed to be flexible, adaptive, and able to treat data with low time resolution. The module includes alternative forecasting techniques, such as autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA), neural networks, and exponential smoothing, allowing the application of the right forecasting strategy each time. The presented test results are based on a dataset acquired during a monitoring campaign in two pilot systems, installed during the ER Project in public buildings.",

            "abstract": "Vehicular ad-hoc Networks (VANETs) are an integral part of intelligent transportation systems (ITS) that facilitate communications between vehicles and the internet. More recently, VANET communications research has strayed from the antiquated DSRC standard and favored more modern cellular technologies, such as fifth generation (5G). The ability of cellular networks to serve highly mobile devices combined with the drastically increased capacity of 5G, would enable VANETs to accommodate large numbers of vehicles and support range of applications. The addition of thousands of new connected devices not only stresses the cellular networks, but also the computational and storage requirements supporting the applications and software of these devices. Autonomous vehicles, with numerous on-board sensors, are expected to generate large amounts of data that must be transmitted and processed. Realistically, on-board computing and storage resources of the vehicle cannot be expected to handle all data that will be generated over the vehicles lifetime. Cloud computing will be an essential technology in VANETs and will support the majority of computation and long-term data storage. However, the networking overhead and latency associated with remote cloud resources could prove detrimental to overall network performance. Edge computing seeks to reduce the overhead by placing computational resources nearer to the end users of the network. The geographical diversity and varied hardware configurations of resource in a edge-enabled network would require careful management to ensure efficient resource utilization. In this paper, we introduce an architecture which evaluates available resources in real-time and makes allocations to the most logical and feasible resource. We evaluate our approach mathematically with the use of a multi-criteria decision analysis algorithm and validate our results with experiments using a test-bed of cloud resources. Results demonstrate that an algorithmic ranking of physical resources matches very closely with experimental results and provides a means of delegating tasks to the best available resource.",

            "abstract": "Biogas is a renewable, as well as abundant, fuel source which can be utilised in the production of heat and electricity as an alternative to fossil fuels. Biogas can additionally be upgraded via the dry reforming reactions into high value syngas. Nickel-based catalysts are well studied for this purpose but have shown little resilience to deactivation caused by carbon deposition. The use of bi-metallic formulations, as well as the introduction of promoters, are hence required to improve catalytic performance. In this study, the effect of varying compositions of model biogas (CH4\/CO2 mixtures) on a promising multicomponent Ni-Sn\/CeO2-Al2O3 catalyst was investigated. For intermediate temperatures (650 \u00b0C), the catalyst displayed good levels of conversions in a surrogate sewage biogas (CH4\/CO2 molar ratio of 1.5). Little deactivation was observed over a 20 h stability run, and greater coke resistance was achieved, related to a reference catalyst. Hence, this research confirms that biogas can suitably be used to generate H2-rich syngas at intermediate temperatures provided a suitable catalyst is employed in the reaction.",

            "abstract": "Recent studies showed that Fatty Acid Synthase (FASN), a lipogenic enzyme overexpressed in several carcinomas, plays an important role in drug resistance. Furthermore, the enrichment of Breast Cancer Stem Cell (BCSC) features has been found in breast tumors that progressed after chemotherapy. Hence, we used the triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) cell line MDA-MB-231 (231) to evaluate the FASN and BCSC population role in resistance acquisition to chemotherapy. For this reason, parental cell line (231) and its derivatives resistant to doxorubicin (231DXR) and paclitaxel (231PTR) were used. The Mammosphere-Forming Assay and aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) enzyme activity assay showed an increase in BCSCs in the doxorubicin-resistant model. Moreover, the expression of some transcription factors involved in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a process that confers BCSC characteristics, was upregulated after chemotherapy treatment. FASN inhibitors C75, (&minus;)-Epigallocatechin 3-gallate (EGCG), and its synthetic derivatives G28, G56 and G37 were used to evaluate the effect of FASN inhibition on the BCSC-enriched population in our cell lines. G28 showed a noticeable antiproliferative effect in adherent conditions and, interestingly, a high mammosphere-forming inhibition capacity in all cell models. Our preliminary results highlight the importance of studying FASN inhibitors for the treatment of TNBC patients, especially those who progress after chemotherapy.",

The aims of this study were to assess the ADEs of patients with dementia and presenting neuropsychiatric\/behavioral, and psychological symptoms in dementia (BPSD) and to categorize and identify the principal factors that allow to prevent ADEs, and separately ADEs that result in falls. To that end, a one-year prospective study in a psychogeriatric ward (July 2015 to July 2016) was performed. All patients admitted to this ward were eligible for enrolment. Patients who met any of the following criteria were excluded from the study: Patients without cognitive impairment, a length of stay under 7 days, and palliative or previous psychiatric pathology. We included 65 patients (60% women, 84.9 years &plusmn; 6.7) with mild to moderate cognitive impairment, moderate to severe functional dependence, and a high prevalence of geriatric syndromes and comorbidity. A total of 87.7% were taking five or more drugs (mean 9.0 &plusmn; 3.1). ADEs were identified during the interdisciplinary meeting and the follow up by clinical record. Sixty-eight ADEs (81.5% patients) were identified, of which 73.5% were not related to falls. From these, 80% were related to drugs of the nervous system. The Naranjo algorithm determined that 90% of ADEs were probable. The severity of the ADEs was Category E in 34 patients (68%). The number of preventable ADE according to the Schumork&ndash;Thornton test was 58%. The main ADE was drowsiness\/somnolence (27.7%). ADEs related to falls represented a 26.5%. The balance between effective treatment and safety is complex in these patients. A medication review in interdisciplinary teams is an essential component to optimize safety prevention.",

            "abstract": "Insulin exists in the central nervous system, where it executes two important functions in the hypothalamus: the suppression of food intake and the improvement of glucose metabolism. Recent studies have shown that both are exerted robustly in rodents and humans. If intact, these functions exert beneficial effects on obesity and diabetes, respectively. Disruption of both occurs due to a condition known as hypothalamic insulin resistance, which is caused by obesity and the overconsumption of saturated fat. An enormous volume of literature addresses the molecular mechanisms of hypothalamic insulin resistance. IKK&beta; and JNK are major players in the inflammation pathway, which is activated by saturated fatty acids that induce hypothalamic insulin resistance. Two major tyrosine phosphatases, PTP-1B and TCPTP, are upregulated in chronic overeating. They dephosphorylate the insulin receptor and insulin receptor substrate proteins, resulting in hypothalamic insulin resistance. Prolonged hyperinsulinemia with excessive nutrition activates the mTOR\/S6 kinase pathway, thereby enhancing IRS-1 serine phosphorylation to induce hypothalamic insulin resistance. Other mechanisms associated with this condition include hypothalamic gliosis and disturbed insulin transport into the central nervous system. Unveiling the precise molecular mechanisms involved in hypothalamic insulin resistance is important for developing new ways of treating obesity and type 2 diabetes.",

Biological methods, such as whole-cell biocatalyst, promise a simple but highly effective approach to glycosylate biologically active small molecules with remarkable regio- and stereo-selectivity. Herein, we use the entomopathogenic filamentous fungus Isaria fumosorosea ACCC 37814 to biotransform a panel of phenolic natural products, including flavonoids and anthraquinone, into their glycosides. Six new flavonoid (4-O-methyl)glucopyranosides are obtained and structurally characterized using high resolution mass and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopic techniques. These compounds further expand the structural diversity of flavonoid glycosides and may be used in biological study.",

            "abstract": "In this paper, nanostructured TiO2 film was prepared by the by sol-gel process and dip-coating technique with titanium tetraisopropoxide as a precursor. After heat treatment at 550 &deg;C, the deposited film was characterized by means of micro-Raman spectroscopy and atomic force microscopy (AFM). It was found that the TiO2 film consisted of only the TiO2 anatase phase and showed a granular microstructure. Photocatalytic degradation of azithromycin by using sol-gel nanostructured TiO2 film was studied to define the most effective degradation process for potential use in wastewater treatment. Different factors were evaluated during photocatalysis, such as pH (3, 7, and 10), water matrix (ultrapure water and synthetic municipal waste water effluent), influence of another pharmaceutically active compound (sulfamethoxazole, one of the most often detected pharmaceutic compounds in waste waters), and radiation sources (low pressure ultraviolet (UV) mercury lamps with a UV-A and UV-C range; a light-emitting diode (LED) lamp with a radiation peak at 365 nm). The most effective degradation process was achieved with the UV-C irradiation source in matrices at pH 10. The water matrix had little effect on the photocatalytic degradation rates of azithromycin. The presence of sulfamethoxazole in the water matrix decreased the degradation rate of azithromycin, however, only in matrices with a pH level adjusted to 10. During the experiments, five azithromycin degradation products were identified and none of them showed toxic properties, suggesting effective removal of azithromycin. LED 365 nm as the irradiation source was not as effective as the UV-C lamp. Nevertheless, considering the cost, energy efficiency, and environmental aspects of the irradiation source, the LED lamp could be a &ldquo;real-life&rdquo; alternative.",

Unfortunately, riverbank degradation can cause societal impacts such as property loss and sedimentation of in-stream structures, as well as environmental impacts such as water quality impact. The frequency, magnitude, and impact of riverbank collapse events in China and worldwide are forecasted to increase under climate change. To understand and mitigate the risk of riverbank collapse, experimental\/field data in real conditions are required to provide robust calibration and validation of hydraulic and mathematical models. This paper presents an experimental set of tests conducted to characterize riverbank erosion and sediment transport for banks with slopes of 45&deg;, 60&deg;, 75&deg;, and 90&deg; and quantify the amount of sediments transported by the river, deposited within the bank toe or settled in the riverbed after having been removed due to erosion. The results showed interesting comprehension about the characterization of riverbank erosion and sediment transport along the river. These insights can be used for calibration and validation of new and existing numerical models.",

            "abstract": "Industrial dimensional assessment presents instances in which early control is exerted among &ldquo;warm&rdquo; (approx. 600      \u2218C) pieces. Early control saves resources, as defective processes are timely stopped and corrected. Existing literature is devoid of dimensional assessment on warm workpieces. In response to this absence, this manuscript presents the implementation and results of an optical system which performs in-line dimensional inspection of revolution warm workpieces singled out from the (forming) process. Our system can automatically measure, in less than 60 s, the circular runout of warm revolution workpieces. Such a delay would be 20 times longer if cool-downs were required. Off-line comparison of the runout of T-temperature workpieces (27      \u2218C &le; T &le; 560      \u2218C) shows a maximum difference of 0.1 mm with respect to standard CMM (Coordinate Measurement Machine) runout of cold workpieces (27      \u2218C), for workpieces as long as 160 mm. Such a difference is acceptable for the forging process in which the system is deployed. The test results show no correlation between the temperature and the runout of the workpiece at such level of uncertainty. A prior-to-operation Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) test validates the repeatability and reproducibility (R&amp;R) of our measurement system. In-line assessment of warm workpieces fills a gap in manufacturing processes where early detection of dimensional misfits compensates for the precision loss of the vision system. The integrated in-line system reduces the number of defective workpieces by     95 %    .",

The number of disabled students is growing steadily, nevertheless, relatively little is known about the employment experiences and skill development of disabled youth. Following the positive primary preventive approach, this explorative research investigates the role of resilience and employability resources both in preventing perceived negative impact of disability on the employment opportunities and promoting the perception of employability. Fifty disabled students responded to an online questionnaire and their responses were compared to those of a nondisabled sample (N = 190). Motivations and meanings associated with entry into the workplace are equivalent in the two groups, but perceived impact of disability is a risk factor that hinders perceived employability. Resilience resources and soft skills show their effectiveness in reducing perceived disability impact and improving perceived employability, but between group comparison shows differences in the set of available resources. Overall, results provide insights for implementing actions to promote sustainable employment in order to foster a positive, sustainable organizational development.",

            "abstract": "Marginal seas are fundamental to humans for their importance in mariculture resources and commerce. Based on the NOAA 0.25 degree daily Optimum Interpolation (OI) sea surface temperature (SST) data set, spatiotemporal changes in mean and extreme SST in the East China Seas (ECSs) were examined for from 1982 to 2017. As a regional average, the annual mean SST has notably increased at a rate of 0.21 &plusmn; 0.08 &deg;C per decade. The warming SST during 1982&ndash;2017 is probably related to the influence from a recent strengthening and westward extension of the WPSH. There are also notable warming trends in annual minimum and maximum SST. Spatially, the rapid warming of annual mean SSTs are located in the vicinity of the Yangtze Estuary, exceeding 0.2 &deg;C per decade and part of the ECS-Kuroshio. This pattern may be largely affected by the spatial changes of minimum SST. Rapid warming of maximum SST can be found across the region, from the northern East China Sea (ECS) to the Bohai Sea. Since 1982, extreme hot days (EHDs) have undergone an obvious increasing trend, at a rate of 15.2 days per decade. Conversely, extreme cold days (ECDs) have been decreasing. Notably, the largest increase of EHDs appears in the western ECS and the Bohai Sea, which both have rich marine ecosystems. The trend of EHDs has a significant relationship to mean SST, suggesting that there will be a further increase in EHDs under continued warming in the ECSs. These findings emphasize the importance and urgency of strategies which should be planned for the adaptation and mitigation of specific types of extreme hot events in this region.",

            "abstract": "Severe droughts can affect water security even in countries with ample water resources. In addition, droughts are estimated to become more frequent in several regions due to changing climate. Drought affects many socio-economic sectors (e.g., agriculture, water supply, and industry), as it did in 2018 in Finland. Understanding the basin-wide picture is crucial in drought management planning. To identify vulnerable and water stressed areas in Finland, a water use-to-availability analysis was executed with a reference drought. Water stress was analyzed with the Water Depletion Index WDI. The analysis was executed using national water permits and databases. To represent a severe but realistic drought event, we modelled discharges and runoffs from the worst drought of the last century in Finland (1939&ndash;1942). The potential for performing similar analyses in data scarce contexts was also tested using estimates from global models as a screening tool. The results show that the South and Southwest of Finland would have problems with water availability during a severe drought. The most vulnerable areas would benefit from drought mitigation measures and management plans. These measures could be incorporated into the EU River Basin Management Plans.",

            "abstract": "Cordyceps species are known to contain numerous bioactive compounds, including cordycepin. Extracts of Cordyceps militaris (CME) are used in diverse medicinal purposes because of their bioactive components. Cordycepin, one of the active components of CME, exhibits anti-proliferative, pro-apoptotic, and anti-inflammatory effects. Cordycepin structurally differs from adenosine in that its ribose lacks an oxygen atom at the 3&prime; position. We previously reported that cordycepin suppresses Epstein&ndash;Barr virus (EBV) gene expression and lytic replication in EBV-associated gastric carcinoma (EBVaGC). However, other studies reported that cordycepin induces EBV gene expression and lytic reactivation. Thus, it was reasonable to clarify the bioactive effects of CME bioactive compounds on the EBV life cycle. We first confirmed that CME preferentially induces EBV gene expression and lytic reactivation; second, we determined that adenosine in CME induces EBV gene expression and lytic reactivation; third, we discovered that the adenosine A1 receptor (ADORA1) is required for adenosine to initiate signaling for upregulating BZLF1, which encodes for a key EBV regulator (Zta) of the EBV lytic cycle; finally, we showed that BZLF1 upregulation by adenosine leads to delayed tumor development in the EBVaGC xenograft mouse model. Taken together, these results suggest that adenosine is an EBV lytic cycle inducer that inhibits EBVaGC development.",

            "abstract": "(1) Background: Smartphone dietary assessment apps can be acceptable and valid data collection methods but have predominantly been validated in highly educated women, and none specifically measured eating-out habits in young adults. (2) Methods: Participants recorded their food and beverage consumption for three days using the Eat and Track (EaT) app, and intakes were compared with three dietitian-administered 24-h recall interviews matched to the same days as the reference method. Wilcoxon signed-rank or t-tests, correlation coefficients and Bland&ndash;Altman plots assessed agreement between the two methods for energy and percentage energy from nutrients (%E). (3) Results: One hundred and eighty nine of 216 participants (54% females, 60% resided in higher socioeconomic areas, 49% university-educated) completed the study. There were significant differences in median energy intake between methods (p &lt; 0.001), but the EaT app had acceptable agreement for most nutrient densities at the group level. Correlation coefficients ranged from r = 0.56 (%E fat) to 0.82 (%E sugars), and between 85% and 94% of participants were cross-classified into the same or adjacent quartiles. Bland&ndash;Altman plots showed wide limits of agreement but no obvious biases for nutrient densities except carbohydrate in males. (4) Conclusions: The EaT app can be used to assess group nutrient densities in a general population of 18-to-30-year olds.",

The key challenge is to track the aircraft with occlusion caused by decoys and drastic appearance changes resulting from a diversity of attacking angles. To address this challenge, an aircraft-tracking algorithm was proposed, which provides robustness in tracking the aircraft against the decoys. We reveal the inherent structure and infrared signature of the aircraft, which are used as discriminative features to track the aircraft. The anti-interference method was developed based on simulated images but validate the effectiveness on both real infrared image sequences without decoys and simulated infrared imagery. For frequent occlusion caused by the decoys, the mechanism of occlusion detection is exploited according to the variation of the model distance in tracking process. To have a comprehensive evaluation of tracking performance, infrared-image sequences with different attack angles were simulated, and experiments on benchmark trackers were performed to quantitatively evaluate tracking performance. The experiment results demonstrate that our aircraft-tracking method performs favorably against state-of-the-art trackers.",

            "abstract": "The rapid rise and implementation of Smart Systems (i.e., multi-functional observation and platform systems that depict settings and\/or identify situations or features of interest, often in real-time) has inversely paralleled and readily exposed the reduced capacity of human and societal systems to effectively respond to environmental hazards. This overarching review and essay explores the complex set of interactions found among Smart, Societal, and Environmental Systems. The resulting rise in the poorly performing response solutions to environmental hazards that has occurred despite best practices, detailed forecast information, and the use and application of real-time in situ observational platforms are considered. The application of Smart Systems, relevant architectures, and ever-increasing numbers of applications and tools development by individuals as they interact with Smart Systems offers a means to ameliorate and resolve confounding found among all of the interdependent Systems. The interactions of human systems with environmental hazards further expose society&rsquo;s complex operational vulnerabilities and gaps in response to such threats. An examination of decision-making, the auto-reactive nature of responses before, during, and after environmental hazards; and the lack of scalability and comparability are presented with regard to the prospects of applying probabilistic methods, cross-scale time and space domains; anticipated impacts, and the need to account for multimodal actions and reactions&mdash;including psycho-social contributions. Assimilation of these concepts and principles in Smart System architectures, applications, and tools is essential to ensure future viability and functionalities with regard to environmental hazards and to produce an effective set of societal engagement responses. Achieving the promise of Smart Systems relative to environmental hazards will require an extensive transdisciplinary approach to tie psycho-social behaviors directly with non-human components and systems in order to close actionable gaps in response. Pathways to achieve a more comprehensive understanding are given for consideration by the wide diversity of disciplines necessary to move forward in Smart Systems as tied with the societal response to environmental hazards.",

Pd NPs were deposited on organic nanofiber materials by DC magnetron sputtering. The temperature dependence of the sensitivity at 25 ppm H2 was characterized and discussed, and the maximum response of the sensor increased linearly with increasing measurement temperature. Performances of the hydrogen sensor were investigated with hydrogen concentration ranging from 5 ppm to 50 ppm. This sensor exhibits high sensitivity, with the response up to 6.55% for H2 as low as 5 ppm, and the output response of the hydrogen sensor increased linearly with the square root of hydrogen concentration. A cycling test between pure nitrogen and 25 ppm hydrogen concentration was performed, and the hydrogen sensor exhibited excellent consistency.",

These are meant to convey to policy makers how short-term adaptations can act as elements of longer-term adaptation strategies. However, sets of Adaptation Pathways do not convey the individual pathway&rsquo;s relative costs and benefits. To address this problem in relation to urban pluvial flooding, an economic analysis of a set of Adaptation Pathways was conducted. Initially, a methodology to conduct an economic assessment for deterministic climate change scenarios is developed. This methodology is then modified, using methods that underpin real options to assess how a pathway performs across a bundle of possible futures. This delivered information on how the performance of adaptations can vary across different climate change scenarios. By comparing the deterministic analysis to the new method, it was found that the order in which options are implemented greatly affects the financial performance of an Adaptation Pathway, even if the final combination of options is identical. The presented methodology has the potential to greatly improve decision making by informing policy makers on the potential performance of adaptation strategies being considered.",

As a result, DC distribution research is actively underway to cope with the sudden digitization and decentralization of load environment and power supply. To verify the possibility of DC distribution, Korea Electric Power Corporation (KEPCO) Research Institute made a DC distribution system connected with a real power system in Gwangju. The construction of the demonstration area mainly includes design of protection and grounding systems, operating procedures of insulation monitoring device (IMD), and construction of power converters. Furthermore, this paper goes beyond the simulation and the lab testing to apply DC distribution to a real system operation in advance. It is designed as a long-distance low-loaded customer for rural areas and operated by the DC distribution. In addition, safety and reliability are confirmed through field tests of DC distribution elements such as power conversion devices, protection and grounding systems. In particular, to improve the reliability of non-grounding system, the insulation monitoring device was installed and the algorithms of its operational procedures are proposed. Finally, this paper analyzes the problems caused by operating the actual DC distribution and suggests solutions accordingly.",

We adopt low-complexity time-switching (TS) protocol to realize SWIPT at the energy-constrained relay node, and formulate an EE maximization problem in which TS factor and transmit power control are needed to be jointly optimized. Since the formulated problem is non-convex and difficult to solve, we propose an algorithm combining fractional programming and alternating convex optimization to optimize TS factor and transmit power iteratively with low complexity. Simulation results are provided to demonstrate the convergence of the proposed algorithm, as well as the performance gains in terms of EE compared with other existing schemes.",

            "abstract": "Practically, IgG charge can contribute significantly to thermodynamic nonideality, and hence to solubility and viscosity. Biologically, IgG charge isomers exhibit differences in clearance and potency. It has been known since the 1930s that all immunoglobulins carry a weak negative charge in physiological solvents. However, there has been no systematic exploration of this fundamental property. Accurate charge measurements have been made using membrane confined electrophoresis in two solvents (pH 5.0 and pH 7.4) on a panel of twelve mAb IgGs, as well as their F(ab&rsquo;)2 and Fc fragments. The following observations were made at pH 5.0: (1) the measured charge differs from the calculated charge by ~40 for the intact IgGs, and by ~20 for the Fcs; (2) the intact IgG charge depends on both Fv and Fc sequences, but does not equal the sum of the F(ab)&rsquo;2 and Fc charge; (3) the Fc charge is consistent within a class. In phosphate buffered saline, pH 7.4: (1) the intact IgG charges ranged from 0 to &minus;13; (2) the F(ab&rsquo;)2 fragments are nearly neutral for IgG1s and IgG2s, and about &minus;5 for some of the IgG4s; (3) all Fc fragments are weakly anionic, with IgG1 &lt; IgG2 &lt; IgG4; (4) the charge on the intact IgGs does not equal the sum of the F(ab&rsquo;)2 and Fc charge. In no case is the calculated charge, based solely on H+ binding, remotely close to the measured charge. Some mAbs carried a charge in physiological salt that was outside the range observed for serum-purified human poly IgG. To best match physiological properties, a therapeutic mAb should have a measured charge that falls within the range observed for serum-derived human IgGs. A thermodynamically rigorous, concentration-dependent protein&ndash;protein interaction parameter is introduced. Based on readily measured properties, interaction curves may be generated to aid in the selection of proteins and solvent conditions. Example curves are provided.",

            "abstract": "Serotype 4 fowl adenovirus (FAdV-4) is the main pathogen for hydropericardium syndrome (HPS) in chickens. It has caused major economic losses in the global poultry industry. Currently, FAdV-4&prime;s transmission routes in chickens remain unclear. Here we investigate the airborne transmission routes of FAdV-4 in chickens. A total of 45 ten-day-old chickens were equally divided into three groups (infected group\/isolator A, airborne group\/isolator B, and control group\/isolator C). Of note, isolators A and B were connected by a leak-free pipe. The results showed that the virus could form a viral aerosol, detected in isolators two days post infection (dpi). The viral aerosol reached a peak at 4 dpi in the infected group. Healthy chickens in the airborne group were infected by the virus at 8 dpi. The chickens of the airborne group demonstrated subclinical symptoms capable of shedding the virus for some time. This finding suggests that FAdV-4 can be efficiently transmitted among chickens by aerosol transmission. These findings have significant implications for developing strategies to control this infectious disease epidemic.",

            "abstract": "Introduction: There are many reports on the application of medicinal plants in traditional medicine, as well as numerous applications of metallic nanoparticles in different biomedical fields. Plant extract mediated green synthesis of nanoparticles and investigations on their therapeutic effects are new concepts. The medicinal plant of Cuminum cyminum L. includes a wide range of secondary metabolites with a high reducing power, which can be used for green biosynthesis of silver nanoparticles. The main aims of this study were phytochemical analysis of seed aqueous extract of Cuminum cyminum, biosynthesis of silver nanoparticles using this extract, the achievement of optimization condition for the synthesis of silver nanoparticles, and assessment of biological activaties of both the extract and the synthesized nanoparticles.\n\u00a0\nMaterials & Methods: Total phenol and flavonoid, reducing sugar, starch, and ascorbic acid contents were measured by Folin-Ciocalteo, aluminum chloride, dinitrosalicylic acid, anthrone, and dinitrophenyl hydrazine reagents, respectively. The Ag+ ions reduction and characterization of silver nanoparticles were assessed by UV-Visible spectrophotometry, X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and scanning electron microscopy. Antioxidant activity of the samples was screened by DPPH free radical scavenging. Antibacterial activity of the samples was also evaluated against four gram-positive and -negative bacteria namely, Bacillus cereus (PTCC 1247), Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 25923), Escherichia coli (ATCC 35218), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 27853) by disc diffusion method. In addition, antifungal activity was assessed against Fusarium oxysporum.\n\u00a0\nFindings: The indings indicated that the seed extract contained the high amounts of total phenolic and flavonoidic compositions, as well as sugar, starch, and ascorbic acid. Different analyses showed that the mean size of the synthesized nanoparticles was 5-45 nm in the optimal condition. The samples had proper antioxidant potential (IC50=1.35-1.67 mg\/ml) and the extract in combination with silver nanoparticles represented synergistic effect in DPPH free radical scavenging (IC50=1.35 mg\/ml). In addition, the investiogated samples had a good antibacterial activity against some of tested bacteria and also antifungal activity against Fusarium oxysporum.\n\u00a0\nDiscussion & Conclusions: It seems that the secondary metabolites of Cuminum cyminum have good potential for the reduction and stabilization of the synthesized Ag nanoparticles. Both the seed extract and synthesized nanoparticles using this extract have considerable biological activities and may be used in antioxidant nutrient production or medicinal supplements in future.",

            "abstract": "Studies carried out with synchrotron radiation have shown that micro-beam radiation therapy (MRT) has unique advantages in the treatment of cancerous tumors. In this method, the determination of dose distribution and calculation of peak to valley dose ratio (PVDR) are considered as the most important steps in treatment planning. The PVDR is a criterion to evaluate the destruction of cancer cells and protection of normal cells in the tissues surrounding a tumor.\n\n\n\u00a0\nMaterials and Methods: Using a multi-slit collimator, planar sliced beams were generated in an X-ray generator in order to determine dose distribution in a multilayer phantom made of plexiglass. An ionization chamber was used to measure absorbed dose. Given the large size of the sensitive area of the chamber in comparison with the narrow beams, a mono-slit collimator made of tungsten with a slit of 0.3\u00d77.5 mm2 in its center was placed in front of the ionization chamber. Furthermore, by using Geant4 computer code, a model, including X-ray source, multi-slit collimator, phantom, mono-slit collimator, and detector, was designed to compare experimental and simulation results.\n\u00a0\nFindings: The investigation of dose distribution in the phantom with both methods indicated the presence of peaks and valleys. Given the low intensity of X-ray beam generated by the X-ray generator, and limited exposure time, the experimental errors were considerable. When using 1 mm (Air)+0.5 mm (W) collimator, PVDRs were obtained as 8.7 and 10.5 for ionization chamber and simulation, respectively, in the depth of 8 mm of the phantom. On the other hand, with a 1 mm (Air)+1 mm (W)\u00a0 collimator, the values obtained for this parameter were 11.1 and 13.3 for ionization chamber and simulation, respectively.\n\u00a0\nConclusions: Based on the results, a multi-slit collimator made of tungsten could produce multi-slice X-ray. The estimated dose distribution using the Geant4 code was more accurate than the one obtained through ionization chamber, which can be due to the possibility of using a detector in much smaller dimensions in the Geant4 code.",

It seems that physical activity and circadian rhythms are effective in the changes of BNP concentration. Regarding this, the aim of the present study was to investigate the acute effects of low-volume high-intensity interval aerobic exercises in the morning and evening on BNP changes and double product in active men.\n\u00a0\nMaterials and Methods: This study was conducted on 11 male physical education students of Jahrom University, Jahrom, Iran. The study population was selected using the purposive sampling technique. The participants were subjected to two separate sessions (with an interval of 3 days) of low-volume high-intensity aerobic exercise in the morning and evening. Blood samples were collected before and immediately after every activity both in the morning and evening. Data analysis was performed in SPSS software (version 17) using independent t-test to compare the mean pretest and posttest upon each session and obtain the mean difference between the morning and evening data. P-value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.\n\u00a0\nResults: The results showed that BNP concentrations increased after exercise in the morning and evening; however, this increase was not statistically significant (P>0.05). In addition, the results showed that the double product in the morning and evening significantly enhanced after performing the exercises (P=0.001). There was a significant difference between the BNP concentrations obtained in morning and evening in terms of double product (P=0.035).\n\u00a0\nConclusions: Despite the lack of a significant difference between morning and evening BNP concentrations, due to the lower mean concentration of BNP in the evening, it seems that exercise in the evening exerted less stress on the myocardial wall and could be more appropriate.",

Glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78) is an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) protein that is expressed on the trophoblast cells. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the presence of anti-GRP78 antibodies in the sera of women with RPL.\n\u00a0\nMaterials & Methods: This case-control study was conducted 80 women referring to the Infertility Center of Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran, during 2014-2016. The study population was assigned into two groups of case entailing 38 women with unexplained RPL and control including 42 healthy pregnant women with no history of miscarriage and a minimum of two successful pregnancies. The measurement of the anti-GRP78 antibody in the sera of the two groups was performed using the\u00a0enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Furthermore, western blot technique was used to assess the expression of GRP78 in placenta tissue for both groups.\n\u00a0\nFindings: The results of the western blot demonstrated the expression of GRP78 on the trophoblast cells in both groups. Furthermore, anti-GRP78 antibodies were detected in both case and control groups through ELISA. The case group had a lower level of anti-GRP78 antibodies; however, this difference was not statistically significant (P=0.1).\n\u00a0\nDiscussion & Conclusions: The findings of the current study revealed no significant difference [Zamen1]\u00a0between anti-GRP78 antibody level in RPL patients and healthy pregnant subjects.",

            "abstract": "Introduction: Menopause is the most important event during the middle age period, which is characterized by cessation of menstruation for at least 12 months (not related to pregnancy, breast-feeding, or other hormonal disorders). Due to hormonal changes during this period, the risk of many diseases including osteoporosis and heart disease increases, therefore, studying this critical period of life seems essential.\n\u00a0\nMaterials & Methods: Totally, 34 papers were collected and analyzed by searching Magiran, Irandoc, Google scholar, ISI, Cochrane, Embase, SID, and PubMed databases. To pool mean menopause age in the retrieved studies, we used mean, standard deviation, and sample size in each study. The weighted mean and normal distribution were used to synthesize results. Confidence intervals were computed using random effects model in meta-analysis.\u00a0 The heterogeneity of the studies has been checked by I\u00b2 statistics and the data were analyzed by applying R and STATA (Ver11\/2) software.\n\u00a0\nFindings:\u00a0 The total number of women in the studies was 27,250 with the mean age of 51.8 \u00b1 4.79 years. The average age of menopause was 48.26 years (95% CI 46.85 to 49.67). Ten articles with the total sample size of 13,260 showed that the median of pregnancy age was 49.7 \u00b1 1.52 years.\n\u00a0\nDiscussion & Conclusions: According to the results of the recent studies and the low mean age of menopause in Iran compared to the developed countries, to reduce the complications of this important period of life, extended health programs are recommended to be planned and implemented to improve the quality of life in women experiencing menopause.",

The purpose of this study was to isolate Azotobacter with the power of producing melanin and optimize its production and the effect of its combination with titanium oxide nanoparticles on the protection against ultraviolet light (UV).\n\u00a0\nMaterials & Methods: Overall, 200 soil samples from different parts of Qom, Iran, were cultured on Ashby's mannitol agar medium using Bio-test method. The effect of optimization of conditions such as pH, temperature, glucose source, amino acid sources, and aeration on the amount of melanin production was assessed. Afterwards, melanin was extracted, conjugated with titanium nanosilicate compound, and then the effect of each of the compounds on Escherichia coli was examined under the influence of UV based on time.\n\u00a0\nFindings: Melanin-producing Azotobacter vinelandii species were isolated. The optimum pH was determined about 7.5. Glucose at different concentrations (1-6%) reduced the production of the product. Methionine amino acid had an inhibitory effect, while tyrosine amino acid increased the production rate. Tryptophan amino acid at 0.1-0.7% also increased the production rate, while cysteine and phenylalanine did not change the production rate. The combination of titanium oxide with melanin showed a significant protective effect against Escherichia coli bacterium under the influence of UV.\n\u00a0\nDiscussion & Conclusions: Native isolates of Azotobacter isolated from agricultural soil with the power of producing melanin can be used as a source for its use in the industry.",

Biofilm formation increases resistance to unfavorable conditions and biocides. Of the strategies to deal with biofilms is using different plant compounds and nanoparticles. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of silver nanoparticles, lavender extract, and their combined effects in different concentrations on Klebsiella pneumoniae biofilm.\n\u00a0\nMaterials & Methods: The anti-biofilm effect and reduced rate of biofilm formation of Klebsiella pneumoniae in separated and combined treatments of stoechas extract (Lavandula stoechas) and silver-nanoparticles at 24, 48 and 72 hours were measured by colorimetric microtiter method. Phenolic content was also measured by Folin-Ciocalteu method.\n\u00a0\nFindings: Phenolic content was about 113.3\nmg\/g. In the absence of treatments, Klebsiella was able to form strong biofilms. Three-way-analysis of variance of the main and interacting effects of silver nanoparticles, lavender extract and time on biofilm formation was significant. Silver nanoparticle and lavander extract at concentrations of 125 and 0.0625 ug\/mL, respectively, and co-treatments at 62.5 and 0.03125 ug\/mL concentrations, respectively, significantely reduced biofilm formation.\n\u00a0\nDiscussion & Conclusions: By increasing time, biofilm formation reduced due to effects of treatments. Biofilm formation also reduced by increasing concentration of the treatments. The result of this survey showed that silver-nanoparticles and lavender extract have synergistic effects on reduction of biofilm formation.",

            "abstract": "Introduction: Education and research are two thinking based processes. Nowadays, the main function of educational institutions is evaluated by thinking. This study aimed to determine the dominant thinking styles among medical and dental students of Ilam University of Medical Sciences (IUMS).\nMaterials and methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted on all medical and dental students of IUMS in the academic year of 2016-2017. Data was collected by Sternberg\u2019s standard thinking style inventory and a demographic data questionnaire. Data analysis was carried out with the software SPSS 20 using descriptive statistical analysis methods and t-test.\nResults: In total, 497 students of IUMS participated in the study. Among whom 395 (79.5%) were medicals students and 102 (20.5%) were dental students. The findings showed significant differences between the legislative and executive thinking styles of medical and dental students (P=0.042 and P=0.024 respectively), more specifically, the mean score of legislative thinking style was found to be higher among dental students than that of medical students, and the opposite relation was found in the mean scores\u00a0 of executive thinking style. Comparison of mean scores of thinking style dimensions between medical and dental students showed significant differences in some but not all dimensions.\nConclusion: Considering the differences found in thinking styles of medical and dental students and their effects in emergence of unique behavioral and decision-making characteristics in medical and dental students, educational planners and professors should attempt to adjust their teaching methods and professional approach according to students individual features in terms of thinking style and preferences so as to foster the growth and flourish of their thinking, academic, and clinical capabilities. The results of the study showed significant differences between the legislative and executive thinking styles of medical and dental students, also regarding the different dimensions of thinking styles of medical and dental students, some significant differences in some but not all dimensions were reported.",

Here, we present our experience on ureteric stone removal without any lithotripsy interventions. Combination direct vision with basket en-trapping provided a new dimension to our ureteroscope experience.\nMaterials and methods: Here, we reviewed the medical data of our adult patients with \u226410 mm stone size, who received primary stone extraction under direct ureteroscopic vision without lithotripsy during a 2-year period. During the six months of follow-up every patient was seen frequently.\nResults: The study included\u00a069\u00a0patients\u00a0from\u00a0both\u00a0sexes with ages\u00a0ranging\u00a0from 18 to 68 years. We obtained 92.7% success rate. The average\u00a0length\u00a0of\u00a0operative\u00a0procedures\u00a0was 25.3 \u00b1 10.4 min with a 14.4 % complication rate.\nConclusion: Ureteral stone extraction requires considerable caution and may be associated with some complications. Stone extraction under direct ureteroscope guidance facilitates this procedure, especially in the distal stones. It seems combination direct live imaging with basket en-trapping may be helpful in these precise cases.",

The early  experimentation with tobacco, alcohol (before 14 years old) or cannabis (before 15 years old) is related to a higher prevalence of daily tobacco and cannabis consumption, to a daily alcohol-abusive patterns and to either regular multiple-drugs  consumption or concurrent consumption of 2 or more drugs in the last month. It has been found too an association with  negative consequences caused by alcohol and drugs  consumption in economic, academic, and family life. This research reveals that the strength of these kinds of associations increases with the number of consumed substances very early. In fact, that happens in almost all the analyzed associations, and this is the reason of our suggestion of including an analysis of recocious starting of gathered consumptions in future researches.",

The main purpose of the study was to investigate whether the user group or the nature of use had changed since the first survey conducted a year earlier. As in the first survey we also wanted to gather feedback on satisfaction levels and suggestions for improvements to the <em>Early Canadiana Online<\/em> (ECO) site. A new section was added to the second survey to explore the use of ECO in teaching and research. Overall, findings showed that the user group and nature of use of the materials were remarkably similar to the first survey. Enthusiasm for ECO remained high but many of the requests for changes to existing features and the suggestions for enhancements to the site were the same as those in the first survey. The survey revealed that respondents who used ECO for teaching and research differed from other respondents in a number of ways. We close by discussing the implications of these findings for digital libraries in general and the value of studying digital library users over time.",

            "abstract": "<p>Este art\u00edculo examina la expansi\u00f3n econ\u00f3mica que se produjo en la Araucan\u00eda durante la primera parte del siglo XX y el impacto que tuvo esta expansi\u00f3n en la sociedad mapuche. La fundaci\u00f3n de ciudades, los nuevos circuitos econ\u00f3micos que se generan al interior de la regi\u00f3n y las nuevas conexiones de la econom\u00eda regional con mercados externos, provocaron una expansi\u00f3n econ\u00f3mica que favoreci\u00f3 a las comunidades mapuches que encontraron en aquellos mercados un espacio en el cual colocar su producci\u00f3n. Esta etapa (1890-1920\/30) corresponde a la fase exitosa del acoplamiento de la regi\u00f3n al Estado; sin embargo, estuvo acompa\u00f1ado tambi\u00e9n de una serie de abusos al ind\u00edgena, entre los cuales el m\u00e1s grave fue el robo de sus tierras. La fase exitosa fue seguida por una p\u00e9rdida del dinamismo econ\u00f3mico que afect\u00f3 de un modo particular a los peque\u00f1os y medianos campesinos, sobre todo despu\u00e9s de los a\u00f1os 30. Las comunidades mapuches sintieron los efectos de esta situaci\u00f3n, debiendo algunos de sus miembros emigrar hacia Concepci\u00f3n, Santiago o Valpara\u00edso en busca de mejores horizontes. Fue, por lo tanto, una \u00e9poca de luces y sombras para la regi\u00f3n y su poblaci\u00f3n mapuche. La expansi\u00f3n econ\u00f3mica no se pudo sostener y los abusos cometidos contra el pueblo mapuche debilitaron sus defensas para enfrentar la contracci\u00f3n econ\u00f3mica que se produjo a partir de 1930.<\/p>",

No se tiene definido el rol de las organizaciones en la adopci\u00f3n de est\u00e1ndares como tampoco hay claridad de la contribuci\u00f3n de las organizaciones, para contribuir a que el proceso sea completo. El trabajo tiene como objetivo identificar el rol de los diferentes actores en los procesos de implementaci\u00f3n y adopci\u00f3n de est\u00e1ndares en los productores hort\u00edcolas de la regi\u00f3n noroeste de M\u00e9xico. Con la informaci\u00f3n de campo, mediante una estimaci\u00f3n econom\u00e9trica se formul\u00f3 un modelo Logit que permite determinar la contribuci\u00f3n de las organizaciones en el proceso de adopci\u00f3n de est\u00e1ndares.

Las organizaciones de productores ejercen una actividad importante especialmente en la representatividad en las negociaciones y por \u00faltimo las instituciones p\u00fablicas son las que contribuyen en menor forma con el proceso de adopci\u00f3n.",

A continuaci\u00f3n, se hace una comparaci\u00f3n, de qu\u00e9 forma est\u00e1 presente esta \u00e9poca en las diferentes historiograf\u00edas occidentales y el desarrollo que han hecho para llegar a esta \u00e9poca bien definida de entre 300 y 350 a\u00f1os. Se constata que la cesura entre \u00c9poca Moderna y contempor\u00e1nea es mucho m\u00e1s clara y marcada en algunas historiograf\u00edas (como la francesa o la espa\u00f1ola) que en otras (como la anglosajona o la alemana).

El avance de las t\u00e9cnicas de biolog\u00eda molecular, permite la disponibilidad de nuevas herramientas en el mejoramiento gen\u00e9tico vegetal, fomentando la fijaci\u00f3n de genes involucrados en la expresi\u00f3n de caracteres fenot\u00edpicos deseables de inter\u00e9s comercial y productivo. El objetivo fue estandarizar un m\u00e9todo de extracci\u00f3n de ADN gen\u00f3mico espec\u00edfico a partir de tejido foliar fresco y seco, al igual que de pl\u00e1ntulas. Se encontraron diferencias significativas entre las dos especies. En C. alliodora el tipo y estado del tejido no fue un factor limitante para la extracci\u00f3n, la cual dependi\u00f3 solamente del m\u00e9todo empleado. Por el contrario, T. rosea present\u00f3 limitaciones en la extracci\u00f3n y amplificaci\u00f3n del ADN obtenido a partir de tejido seco, lo cual se atribuy\u00f3 a la concentraci\u00f3n significativa de polisac\u00e1ridos, polifenoles y otros metabolitos secundarios, tambi\u00e9n reportados en otras investigaciones para esta especie. Se cuantific\u00f3 el ADN extra\u00eddo y se evalu\u00f3 su calidad mediante la amplificaci\u00f3n del ADN utilizando microsat\u00e9lites. Los datos se sometieron a An\u00e1lisis de Componentes Principales (ACP) y An\u00e1lisis Factorial M\u00faltiple (AFM). Con base en los resultados, se estandariz\u00f3 un protocolo de extracci\u00f3n de ADN para cada especie y se defini\u00f3 el tejido foliar \u00f3ptimo para dicho proceso.",

            "abstract": "Jika sebagian kalangan feminis muslim menolak riwayat hadis yang menyebutkan tulang rusuk sebagai asal-usul kejadian perempuan pertama kali karena secara tidak langsung menyimbolkan posisi sub-ordinasi bagi perempuan, sebagian kaum sufi, justru memanfaatkan riwayat tersebut dalam penjelasan mereka dan memaknainya secara positif.\u00a0 Kaum sufi justru menilainya sebagai simbol saling ketergantungan, cinta kasih, dan keberpasangan antara laki-laki dan perempuan. Penulis dalam tulisan ini menyimpulkan bahwa dalam pandangan kaum sufi, perempuan semenjak awal penciptaannya telah ditakdirkan untuk menjadi pasangan bagi laki-laki, sehingga antara keduanya jadi saling melengkapi dan saling ketergantungan. Pandangan ini, tentu saja menepis anggapan tentang subordinasi bagi perempuan.\u00a0 Pandangan kaum sufi dalam kasus ini sejalan dengan apa yang dikemukakan oleh kaum feminis muslim kontemporer. Namun demikian, berbeda dengan langkah yang diambil sebagian feminis muslim kontemporer, kaum sufi pada umumnya lebih memilih menggunakan ta\u2019w\u020bl sehingga memberi makna positif ketika memahami hadis-hadis yang menyebutkan asal usul penciptaan perempuan ketimbang mereka harus mencurigai para periwayatnya atau bahkan menganulir hadis-hadis Nabi yang dinilai sah\u020bh oleh mayoritas ulama.\n\n\nIf some Muslim feminists reject the tradition that argues that the Prophet Adam\u2019s ribs as the origin of the first female event for it indirectly symbolizes the subordinate positions for women, some Sufis instead use the narratives in their explanations and positively interpret them. The Sufis judged the notion as a symbol of interdependence, love, and belonging between men and women. The writer in this paper concludes that in the view of the Sufis, women, since the beginning of their creation, have been destined to become a partner for men, so that between the two become complementary and interdependent. This view, of course, dismisses the notion of women\u2019s subordination. The Sufi\u2019s view in this case is in line with what contemporary Muslim feminists have argued. However, in contrast to the steps taken by some contemporary Muslim feminists, Sufis generally prefer to use the ta'w\u020bl to provide a positive meaning in understanding the traditions which mention the origin of women's creation rather than to suspect their narrators or even annul The Prophet hadiths considered valid (sah\u020bh) by the majority of scholars.",

            "title": "NAFS IN SUFISM PSYCHOLOGY: ROBERT FRAGER\u2019S PERSPECTIVE",
            "abstract": "Objek utama kajian psikologi ialah manusia yang terdiri dari jiwa dan raga. Dalam psikologi, raga manusia dapat berfungsi atau beraktifitas ketika jiwa mampu menggerakkannya dalam bentuk motif. Secara garis besar, jiwa bergerak yang berpadu dengan raga membentuk sebuah nama \u201cdiri\/aku (self)\u201d atau dalam satu konsep \u201ckepribadian\u201d. Hal senada juga menjadi bagian dalam kajian Islam (tasawuf\/sufisme), kepribdian (akhlak) melibatkan dua substansi yaitu jasad dan ruh. Dua substansi yang saling berlawanan ini pada prinsipnya saling membutuhkan. Dalam hal ini tentu saja term \u201cnafs\u201d merupakan jembatan untuk memadukan keduanya. Berawal dari ulasan komparatif atau bahkan menyamakan antara Psikologi Barat dan Tasawuf, Robert Frager (seorang psikolog sekaligus syekh) dalam dalam bukunya juga membicarakan term yang sama (nafs). Dalam buku Psikologi sufi yang ia tulis, ia mengaskan bahwa tasawuf adalah pendekatan yang sangat holisik (mengintegasikan antara fisik, psikis dan spirit) dan memahamkan bahwa tasawuf adalah disiplin spiritual bagi semua orang tanpa kelas dan kasta. Dengan demikian, rumusan masalah dalam tulisan ini ialah apa dan bagaimana definisi nafs, posisi dan karakteristik nafs dalam Psikologi Sufi dan tingkatan nafs dalam Psikologi Sufi perspektif Robert Frager. Dalam bagian kesimpulan, penulis menilik pada dua sudut pandang, yaitu sudut perkembangan nafs secara tasawuf dan mengkritisi aspek psikologis yang digunakan Robert Frager. Dalam sudut pandang sufisme, Robert Frager telah melakukan pengembangan dari konsep nafs yang telah dirumuskan al-Ghazali maupun al-Hifni. Namun demikian dalam tulisannya Robert Frager belum menyinggung hirarki kebutuhan yang diprakarsai Abraham Maslow ,terutama tingkat aktualisasi diri.\n\n\nThe main object of psychology study is the human being as a wealth of body and soul. In psychology, the human body can function or act when the soul is able to move it in the form of motive. Broadly speaking, the moving soul that blends with the body forms a name called \"self \/ I\" or in a \"personality\" concept. The same thing is also a part of Islamic studies of tasawuf or sufism, personality (akhlak) involves two substances namely the body and spirit. These two opposing substances in principle need each other. In this case, of course the term \"nafs\" acts as a bridge to combine the two. Starting from a comparative review or even equating between Western Psychology and Sufism, Robert Frager, a psychologist as well as a sheikh, in his book also speaks of the same term (nafs). In his book of Sufi Psychology, he asserts that Sufism is a very holistic approach for it integrates physical, psychic and spirit and underlines that Sufism is a spiritual discipline for all people without class and caste. Thus, the formulation of the problem in this paper is what and how the definition of nafs, positions and characteristics of the nafs in Sufi Psychology and the level of nafs in the Sufi Psychology perspective of Robert Frager. In the conclusion part, the writer looks at two points of view, i.e. the nafs development in tasawuf and critiques the psychological aspects used by Robert Frager. In the view of Sufism, Robert Frager has been developing the concept of the nafs that al-Ghazali and al-Hifni have formulated. However, in his writings Robert Frager has not touched upon the hierarchy of needs initiated by Abraham Maslow, especially the level of self-actualization.",

            "abstract": "The manifestation of human superiority as \u2018ahsan al-taqwim\u2019 can be interpreted as the process of developing the level of \"inner aspect\" of the human called \u2018nafs\u2019. In this context the dimensions of \u2018nafs\u2019 or soul that exists in the human still leaves a long discussion to be examined further for the purposes of parsing, forecasting and controlling human behaviour, either individually or in groups, both in relation to the field of \u2018da'wah\u2019 or education, for the benefit of mobilizing society in nation-building. Therefore, a research on the concept of \u2018taswiyah al-nafs\u2019 in the development of the human person becomes important to be conducted. The results has shown that in the process of \u2018taswiyat al-nafs\u2019, besides having the freedom of will and choosing between \u2018fujur\u2019 or \u2018taqwa\u2019 tendencies, man also have the moral responsibility implied as a subtle command and indirectly to take and choose \u2018taqwa\u2019. It is because, the essence of \u2018taqwa\u2019 is the mastery, control and self-preservation of \u2018al-ahwa'. \u2018Taqwa\u2019 as an effort of mastery, control and self-preservation is a prerequisite for the process of human development as a civilized being. The effort is essentially a process of an endless human self-development to reach the ideal of \u2018insan kamil\u2019\u2014a perfect man reflecting the names and attributes of God\u2014\u2018al-asma'ul-husna\u2019.",

            "abstract": "A single exposure to many viral and bacterial pathogens typically induces life-long immunity, however, the development of the protective immunity to Plasmodium parasites is strikingly less efficient and achieves only partial protection, with adults residing in endemic areas often experiencing asymptomatic infections. Although naturally acquired immunity to malaria requires both cell-mediated and humoral immune responses, antibodies govern the control of malarial disease caused by the blood-stage form of the parasites. A large body of epidemiological evidence described that antibodies to Plasmodium antigens are inefficiently generated and rapidly lost without continued parasite exposure, suggesting that malaria is accompanied by defects in the development of immunological B cell memory. This topic has been of focus of recent studies of malaria infection in humans and mice. This review examines the main findings to date on the processes that modulate the acquisition of memory B cell responses to malaria, and highlights the importance of closing outstanding gaps of knowledge in the field for the rational design of next generation therapeutics against malaria.",

            "abstract": "This article describes a typical Javanese Islamic image that is featured in the movie series \"Saridin\" featuring Saridin as the main play. In his time, Saridin was one of the most important figures in the propagation of Islamic preaching in Pati, his birthplace, with a distinctive religiosity which in some ways was still influenced by Hindu-Buddhist traditions, such as; semedi, selametan, nyadran, and tirakatan. It is an example of a form of Islam-acculturation, which in the macro context is familiarly called \"Islam Nusantara\". Islam Nusantara is often accused of being a destroyer of the basics of true Islam, which for the pro-Islamic group of acculturation means otherwise. Initially, the film was released by the director, Alman Eko Darmo, along with his friends of the Pati humanist as an expression of their anxiety about the static ketoprak art in Pati, as well as the rebirth of Saridin's classic spectacles which are regularly featured in Ketoprak and last in the Mp3 version. On June 30, 2016, CMC successfully conducted the inaugural launch of the Saridin movie series; Saridin Andum Waris, Saridin Ngerombang, and followed by Saridin Geger Palembang and Saridin Ondo Rante in September 2016. The films have received various responses from various parties, including the observers of da'wah of Islamic \u2013acculturation. For them the presence of Saridin the movie series contains educational message that is appropriate for their da'wah media.",

Unfortunately, the person who is reluctant to take responsibility often makes the verses of the Quran justify his behavior. Consequently, the moral spiritual of Qur'an is often politicized for the benefit of the individual, or even his group by putting aside the cultural heritage mentioned above. Yet the essence of holy revelation [al-Quran] always tells us to uphold the truth in diversity culture. The culture of multiculturalism is indeed embodied and legalized in the spiritual of Qur'an.

            "abstract": "Glucocorticoid receptor (GR) signaling is critical for development and function of the heart. Our previous study demonstrated that gestational hypoxia induced epigenetic repression of the GR gene in the developing heart. The present study aims to determine that the alterations of promoter methylation level and epigenetic repression of the GR gene in the developing heart in response to maternal hypoxia is sustained in adult offspring and potential gender differences in the programming of GR gene. Pregnant rats were treated with 10.5% O2 from gestational day 15 (E15) to 21 (E21). Hearts were isolated from 5-month-old male and female offspring with the developing stage being equivalent to 18-year-old human. GR mRNA and protein abundance was determined with real time qRT-PCR and Western blot. GR gene promoter methylation and binding of transcription factors were measured with methylated DNA immunoprecipitation (MeDIP) and Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP). The results showed that antenatal hypoxia significantly decreased the expression of GR mRNA and protein in the hearts of adult male offspring, but not in females, which is ascribed to the differential changes of alternative exon1 mRNA variants of GR gene in male and female hearts in response to prenatal hypoxia. In addition, the downregulation of GR expression in the male heart was correlated with increased methylation levels of CpG dinucleotides in promoters of exon 14, 15, 16, 17, and 110, which resulted in a decrease in the binding of their transcription factors. Thus, the study reveals that antenatal hypoxia results in a reprogramming and long-term change in GR gene expression in the heart by hypermethylation of GR promoter in a sex-differential pattern, which provides a novel mechanism regarding the increased vulnerability of heart later in life with exposure of prenatal hypoxia.",

Por outro lado, podem ocorrer incentivos \u00e0quelas empresas que se mostram preocupadas com o equil\u00edbrio do ecossistema global. O incentivo pode ocorrer de diversas formas, uma delas \u00e9 o interesse de investidores em empresas que s\u00e3o consideradas socialmente respons\u00e1veis. Neste sentido, surgem os Investimentos Socialmente Respons\u00e1veis, que visam contemplar o equil\u00edbrio entre aspectos econ\u00f4micos, ambientais e sociais. Assim, este artigo objetiva verificar se a diversifica\u00e7\u00e3o da carteira de investimentos considerados socialmente respons\u00e1veis maximiza o retorno para o acionista.

Os resultados sugerem que os investimentos selecionados para compor uma carteira de investimentos socialmente respons\u00e1veis proporcionaram retorno superior aos acionistas em 2008, por\u00e9m este resultado positivo se inverte durante a crise financeira mundial ocorrida no in\u00edcio do ano de 2009, o que sugere que n\u00e3o h\u00e1 relacionamento direto com risco e retorno de carteiras de empresas socialmente respons\u00e1veis, por\u00e9m, acreditase que reconhecimento do mercado a estas empresas pode ampliar o apoio s\u00f3cio-ambiental \u00e0s empresas que declaram considerar ou incorporar (priorizar) aspectos ambientais em sua gest\u00e3o.<br>The negative environmental impacts lead the society to press the enterprises to change the way of producing and serving. On the other hand, financial incentives can be made to those enterprises that are worried about the global ecosystem balance. The financial incentive can be made in several ways, one of them is the investor\u2019s interests in enterprises that are considered socially responsible. In this sense, Socially Responsible Investments are the ones which aim at achieving the balance among economical, environmental, and social aspects. Thus, this paper aims at verifying whether the investment portfolio diversification, which are considered socially responsible, maximize the profit to the shareholder. The research is applied in 15 enterprises that integrate the Entrepreneurial Sustainability Index (ESI) and it is considered as descriptive due to its objectives, survey for its data collection, quantitative for its data treatment and analyses - Markowitz technique (1952) was applied. The results suggest that the selected investments to arrange the socially responsible investment portfolios provided higher feedback to the shareholders in 2008, but this positive result is inverted during the worldwide financial crisis at the beginning of 2009 what suggests that there is not direct relationship between risk and profit of socially responsible enterprise portfolios. However, it is believed that these enterprises\u2019 market acknowledgment may widen the social-environmental support to enterprises that consider or embody (prioritize) environmental aspects in their management.",

Once the diagnosis of MC is confirmed, a stepwise treatment algorithm is suggested. In this review, I will introduce the entity of MC and describe the stepwise approach to diagnosis and management by reviewing the available evidence.

            "abstract": "The celebration of yearly festivities and holidays has been one of the most important foci of the subject of lore culture offered to the students studying to become creativity and hobby managers and since 2002 also to students studying culture management at the Viljandi Culture Academy of the University of Tartu.The important aspects of celebrating certain holidays and festivities are being knowledgeable of the former meaning and contents as well as the ability to conceptualise these in personal and future professional life in contemporary postmodern society. The idea is based on the conviction that holiday and festive rituals help to remember the basic values of life and provide an excellent opportunity to organise ourselves.Making preparations for and carrying out a ceremony is based on rich folk calendar tradition. Choosing an appropriate event prompts a constant improvisation in tradition. For acquiring personal experience, it is important that all participants at an event are asked to join in on the activities. We have learned a great deal from participating in the celebrations of the Setu \u2013 the talsip\u00fcha or yuletide, and the women\u2019s feast paabapraasnik in Obinitsa, St. George\u2019s Day in V\u00e4rska, etc. On these festivities and holidays, senior year students act in leading roles as farmers and their wives. In the first years, younger students take part in the events and get acquainted with the established tradition to learn the leading roles for the years to come.The list of celebrated festivities and holidays has expanded over the years. Celebrating Lady Day has the longest history, as in 2005 it will be celebrated for the 9th time; also, St. George\u2019s Day and Martinmas is celebrated for the 5th time. In recent years the collective celebration of All Souls\u2019 Day, St. Catherine\u2019s Day, k\u00fc\u00fcnlap\u00e4ev (lit. Candle Day) on February 2, and Whitsuntide have been added. Over the years, specific rituals and activities have been developed for organising a certain celebration that students of the following years have not considered necessary to change.",

Six (30&#x0025;) were children and 14 (70&#x0025;) adults. In the children, five were boys and one was a girl. Objects swallowed included metal nails. coins, hair pins and a chain pendant. In the adult group, eight (57&#x0025;) were males and six (43&#x0025;) females. Objects swallowed included sewing needles, sharp blades, pieces of glass, paper clips and gravel. The swallowed foreign body in all the patients passed innocuously through the gastrointestinal tract in two to ten (average 4.7) days. Our method of treatment consisted of giving high fiber diet, Metamucil or lactulose and liquid paraffin. There was no mortality.",

For example, this will allow for better retrieval of all the works by a certain author. We focus on variants caused by abbreviations of first names, and show that significant achievements are possible by simple lexical analysis and comparison of names. This is done in two steps: first a pairwise matching of names is performed, and then these are used to find cliques of equivalent names. However, these steps can each be performed in a variety of ways. We therefore conduct an experimental analysis using two real datasets to find which approaches actually work well in practice. Interestingly, this depends on the size of the repository, as larger repositories may have many more similar names.",

Holistic approach in psychosomatic focus on spirituality factor and spiritual support is expected to improve services and psychological condition of the patients. Inflammatory response during hemodialisis procedure hence increased with the evidence of increasing level of serum interleukin-6 (IL-6). Further research is still needed to see the spiritual factors that can decrease the inflammatory factors.\r\n\r\nMethods. Cross sectional study on 51 chronic hemodialisis patients at RSUP. H. Adam Malik and RSU dr. Pirngadi Medan between July-August 2014. Serum IL-6 was measured using quantitative enzyme-linked immune sorbent assay (ELISA) methods. Blood samples and spiritual aspect assessment by handing out FACIT Sp-12 questionnaire to patients were taken in the morning, 30 minutes before hemodialisis.\r\n\r\nResults. Subscale meaning 10.67 (SB 2.66), peace 9.63 (SB 2.19) and faith 11.47 (SB 2.91). Median serum IL-6 level is 5,63 (1,48- 28,88) pg\/mL. Median FACIT Sp-12 is 30,00 (18-48). Correlation test between serum IL-6 level and spiritual aspect have shown statistically weak negative correlation (correlation coefficient -0,330, p=0.018).\r\n\r\nConclusions: spirituality level in chronic hemodialisis patients are higher. Weak negative correlation between serum IL-6 level and spiritual level on chronic hemodialisis patients was found in this study. ",

            "abstract": "Introduction\r\nIron mineralization in Roshtkhar is located in 48 Km east of the city of Roshtkhar and south of the Khorasan Razavi province. It is geologically located in the north east of the Lut block and the Khaf-Bardeskan volcano-plutonic belt. The Khaf-Bardeskan belt is an important metallogenic province since it is a host of valuable ore deposits such as the Kuh-e-Zar Au-Spicularite, the Tanourcheh and the Khaf Iron ore deposits (Karimpour and Malekzadeh Shafaroudi, 2007). Iron and Copper mineralization in this belt are known as the hydrothermal, skarn and IOCG types (Karimpour and Malekzadeh Shafaroudi, 2007). IOCG deposits are a new type of magmatic to hydrothermal mineralization in the continental crust (Hitzman et al., 1992). Precambrian marble, Lower Paleozoic schist and metavolcanics are the oldest rocks of the area. The younger units are Oligocene conglomerate, shale and sandstone, Miocene marl and Quaternary deposits. Iron oxides and Cu sulfides are associated with igneous rocks. Fe and Cu mineralization in Roshtkhar has been subject of a few studies such as Yousefi Surani (2006). This study describes the petrography of the host rocks, ore paragenesis, alteration types, geochemistry, genesis and other features of the Fe and Cu mineralization in the Roshtkhar iron.\r\n\r\nMethods\r\nAfter detailed field studies and sampling, 30 thin sections and 20 polished sections that were prepared from host rocks and ores were studied by conventional petrographic and mineraloghraphic methods in the geology department of the University of Sistan and Baluchestan. 5 samples from the alteration zones were examined by XRD in the Yamagata University in Japan, and 8 samples from the less altered ones were analyzed by XRF and ICP-OES in the Kharazmi University and the Iranian mineral processing research center (IMPRC) in Karaj, respectively. The XRF and ICP-OES data are presented in Table 1.\r\n\r\nResult and discussion \r\nThe host rocks of the Roshtkhar Iron deposit are diorite, diorite porphyry, monzosyenitie porphyry, andesite, basalt and lithic tuff in composition and granular, porphyry, microlitic porphyry and hyalomicrolitic in texture and they consist of plagioclase, K-feldspar, amphibole and pyroxene as main primary minerals. These minerals in altered rocks were replaced by phylosilicates, epidote, carbonates and opaque minerals. There are the following alteration zones in the study area: propylitic, sericitic-propylitic, argillic and silicic. The propylitic alteration is characterized by chlorite and calcite as the dominant hydrothermal minerals and little quartz, sericite, kaolinite, and biotite. Hematie and magnetite occur as the main opaque mineral in this alteration zone. Since the proportion of sericite is relatively high in some parts of this zone, it can be named the propylitic-sericitic alteration zone. The argillic alteration zone occurs intensively in the syenite and it is characterized by clay minerals. The silicic alteration occurs as veinlets, silicic breccias, and other open space fillings and it is characterized by dominant quartz. In this study, we use a simple variation of the Gresens method. This method was redescribed by Grant (2005). The samples that were analyzed are dioritic rocks as less altered rocks, altered rocks and mineralized rocks. Samples from the propylitic-sericitic alteration zone relative to less-altered diorite show enrichment in Cl, Ho, Cr, Nd, Ta, Tb, Er, La, Cs, Cu, Zn, Dy, and Fe and depletion in Na2O, K2O, P2O5, Ba, S, Sr, Ce, Sn, Co, Sm, Mo, Ga, Zr, Th, Ni, Nb, Rb, Yb. \r\nHypogene mineralization in Rhoshtkhar is of two types, i.e. oxide and sulfide mineralization. Oxide mineralization occurs as massive veins mainly in the intrusive rocks and it has been controlled by a fault between the dioritic unit and the diorite porphyry and monzosyenite, and it is characterized by spicularitic hematite and magnetite. The sulfide mineralization mainly occurs as silicic veins and veinlets and it is characterized by pyrite and chalcopyrite. Both of these two types were affected by supergene processes and iron hydroxides (goethite and limonite) and Cu carbonates (malachite and azurite) were formed as a result. The gangue minerals are mainly calcite, quartz and clay minerals. The common textures of the hypogene mineralization are mainly open space filling that are characterized by crustification, layered, geode and vug infill, cockade and comb structures. The supergene mineralization is characterized by both open space filling and replacement textures. Based on ore microscopic studies, the iron oxide minerals of hematite and magnetite were mainly formed earlier than the sulfide minerals of chalcopyrite and pyrite. The hypogene vein deposits such as those of the city of Roshtkhar are mainly formed by hydrothermal fluids.   The ore minerals in the veins and breccias are deposited as a result of simple cooling, depressurization, fluid mixing, boiling and chemical barriers. The Fe and Cu mineralization in Roshtkhar is genetically related to the hydrothermal fluids that were derived from the magma during emplacement of the intrusive rocks. It seems that the spicularitic hematite is a hypogene early phase indicating the oxygen fugacity of formation environment was high. In the lower fO2, magnetite was replaced by hematite and chalcopyrite and pyrite were probably deposited from hydrothermal fluids as a result of a decrease in fO2, temperature or pH and increase of fS2. The Cu carbonates, secondary sulfides and iron hydroxides were formed by oxidation of the primary sulfides and iron oxides in supergene stage.\r\n\r\nReferences \r\nGrant, J.A. 2005.

We aimed to determine the prevalence of HBV infection among pregnant women at the ante-natal clinic of a tertiary care center in Saudi Arabia and to identify the target group for postpartum immunization. <b> Materials and Methods<\/b> : A total of 755 pregnant females who attended the antenatal clinic from June 2005 to June 2006 for the first time - before 38 weeks of gestation - constituted the target of the present study. Blood samples 30-39 were drawn from all subjects and sera were tested for HBV serologic markers including Hepatitis B surface antigen, anti-HBs, and anti-HBc using ELISA technique (third generation). <b> Results<\/b> : The overall prevalence of sero-positive HBsAg among pregnant women was 1.6&#x0025;. As age increased, the prevalence of sero-positive HBsAg significantly increased (&#967;<sup>2<\/sup>  = 116.43, <i> P<\/i>  &lt; 0.001),  30-39 were women aged &#8805;40 were five times more likely to be positive for HBsAg as compared to those &#60; 30 years (OR = 4.78). On the other hand, women aged 40 and over were five times more likely to be susceptible to infection with hepatitis as compared to young women aged &#60; 20 (OR = 5.15). Women susceptible to HBV infection constituted about 80&#x0025; of all pregnant females. <b> Conclusion<\/b> : These findings reflect that the full impact of the Hepatitis B vaccination program that was conducted in 1989 for all Saudi children has not yet reached all pregnant women, with the majority (79.9&#x0025;) being nonimmune and thus liable to HBV infection. Postpartum HB immunization should be recommended in such cases.",

In German terms, it is a M\u00e4rchen, but actually it can be called neither a folktale nor a fairy tale. It was published in 1835 together with three other tales. H. C. Andersen claims to have remembered it from childhood, but no variants or similar tales have been found in Danish folk tradition. It has also been suggested that Andersen's tale is of Eastern origin but this cannot be entirely true, because no such Eastern tale is known to exist. The Princess and the Pea is based on three separate motifs intertwined together: the motif of hypersensitivity; the motif of extraordinary discernment; and the bride test motif. The first two are believed to be of Eastern origin and quite ancient.",

Resultados: La tasa de incidencia de episodios de IT de hasta 15 d\u00edas se redujo en la empresa A (de 48,3 a 20,7).

While one\u2019s home is the symbol of stability, migration can be described as being the opposite of stability. Oral history researchers from the Institute of Philosophy and Sociology of the University of Latvia have continuouslyworked on the M\u0101 ja project since its launch in 1995. They have repeatedly interviewed the residents of an apartment house in Riga and consulted their personal documents. The information collected in the course of the study deals with the period from the year 1936 (when the house was built) to the present day. The study approaches the life stories of the inhabitants as subjective social reconstructions of the past, which are interpreted in the context of the observed residential house and recent history of Latvia.The dynamics of historical conflicts and social processes that took place in the society can be traced in the history of the house. Upon the analogy of this house, migration processes can be identified and viewed in close-up.On the one hand, the house is characterised in this study as an actual property, material value and financial resource, and an important factor for securing material well-being. On the other hand, however, the regaining of and return to the house is seen as something that binds together the disrupted pieces of life and reemerges as the symbol of safety, stability, and the continuity of generations. The house is a spiritual value, an epitome of the past happiness, close people, and memories.",

            "abstract": "Neuroendocrine tumours (NET) are clinically challenging due to their unpredictable behaviour. Nomograms, grading and staging systems are predictive tools with multiple roles in clinical practice, including patient prognostication. The NET nomogram allocates scores for various clinicopathological parameters, calculating percentage estimates for 5- and 10-year disease-specific survival of patients with small bowel (SB) NET. We\r\nevaluated the clinical utility of three prognostic systems in 70 SB NET patients: the NET nomogram, the World Health Organisation (WHO)\/European Neuroendocrine Tumour Society (ENETS) grading system and the American Joint Commission on Cancer (AJCC)\/Union Internationale Contre le Cancer (UICC) TNM staging method. Using Kaplan\u2013Meier methodology, neither the WHO\/ENETS grade (P = 0.6) nor the AJCC\/UICC stage (P = 0.276) systems demonstrated significant differences in patient survival in the cohort. The NET nomogram was well calibrated to our data set, displaying favourable prediction accuracy.\r\nHarrel\u2019s C-index for the nomogram (a measure of predictive power) was 0.65, suggesting good prediction ability. On Kaplan\u2013Meier analyses, there were significant differences in\r\npatient survival when stratified into nomogram score-based risk groups: low-, mediumand high-risk tumours were associated with median estimated survivals of 156, 129 and 112 months, respectively (P = 0.031). Our data suggest that a multivariable analysis-based NET nomogram may be clinically useful for patient survival prediction. This study identifies the limitations of the NET nomogram and the imperfections of other currently used single or binary parameter methodologies for assessing neuroendocrine disease prognosis. The future addition of other variables to the NET nomogram will likely amplify the accuracy of this personalised tool.",

            "title": "Sulfide mineralization in ultramafic rocks of the Faryab ophiolite complex, southern Kerman",
            "abstract": "\r\nIntroduction<br>\r\nWorldwide, Ni-Cu and PGE magmatic sulfide deposits are confined to the lower parts of stratiform mafic and ultramafic complexes.  However, ophiolite mafic and ultramafic complexes have been rarely explored for sulfide deposits despite the fact that they have been extensively explored and exploited for chromite.  Sulfide saturation during magmatic evolution is necessary for sulfide mineralization, in which sulfide melts scavenge chalcophile metals from the parent magma and concentrate them in specific lithological zones. The lack of exploration for sulfides in this environment suggests that sulfide saturation is rarely attained in ophiolite-related magmas. Some ophiolites, however, contain sulfide deposits, such as at Acoje in Philippines, and Cliffs in Shetland, U.K. (Evans, 2000; Naldrett, 2004).   The Faryab ophiolite complex in southern Kerman Province, the most important mining area for chromite deposits in Iran, is located in the southwest part of the Makran Zone. Evidence of sulfide mineralization has been reported there by some authors (e.g. Rajabzadeh and Moosavinasab, 2013). This paper discusses the genesis of sulfides in the Faryab ophiolite using mineral chemistry of the major mineral phases in different rocks of the ophiolite column in order to determine the possible lithological location of sulfide deposits. <br><br>\r\n\r\nMaterials and methods<br>\r\nSeventy three rock samples from cumulate units were collected from surficial occurrences and drill core. The samples were studied using conventional microscopic methods and the mineralogy confirmed by x-ray diffraction. Electron microprobe analysis was carried out on different mineral phases in order to determine the chemistry of the minerals used in the interpretation of magma evolution in the Faryab ophiolite. <br>\r\nLithologically, the Faryab ophiolite complex is divided into two major parts: the northern part includes magmatic rocks and the southern part is comprised of rocks residual after partial melting of the upper mantle. Sulfide mineralization in the complex is confined to cumulate rocks in northern part of ophiolite column. The mineralization is olivine-rich clinopyroxene and wehrlite. Petrographic investigation of sulfides in host ultramafics indicated two sulfide generations. In the first generation, primary magmatic sulfides occurred as interstitial disseminations, generally as anhedral grains.  In the second generation, sulfides formed as veinlets along host rock fractures.  The primary sulfides include pyrrhotite, pentlandite, and secondary digenite and pyrite. The primary sulfide content increases with increasing size and amount of clinopyroxene in host rocks. Associated chromian spinels in host ultramafics display disseminated and massive textures. <br><br>\r\n\r\nDiscussion<br>\r\nGenerally, mineralization in ophiolites is controlled by two major steps: a) partial melting of upper mantle rocks and b) crystal fractionation in a magma chamber (Rajabzadeh and Moosavinasab, 2013). The chemical compositions of the analyzed minerals were then used in estimating the conditions in these two steps. The composition of chromian spinel corresponds to chromite of boninitic melts formed in supra-subduction zone environments. Boninitic melts are produced at high degrees of partial melting of mantle peridotites in the presence of water (Edwards et al., 2002). Silicates of the host rocks are mainly clinopyroxene (diopside and augite) of the composition  Wo47.50 En45.48 Fs3.4, olivine Fo92 and orthopyroxene (enstatite - bronzite) of En85 to En88. The main host ultramafic rocks of sulfides are wehrlite and clinopyroxenite, indicating that the sulfide saturation occurred during magmatic evolution of these rocks. This suggests that sulfide mineralization will occur in the northern part the ophiolite. The sulfide grains are anhedral, amoeboidal in shape,  and appeared as disseminated interstitial phases, indicating that they were trapped as liquid phases during increase in sulfur fugacity and decrease in FeO content and temperature of crystallization of clinopyroxene-rich rocks (Talkington et al., 1984; Von Gruenewaldt et al., 1990). Nickel-rich pentlandite is the main sulfide in the Faryab complex. The composition of this is mineral is consistent with the crystallization in an equilibrium condition (Song et al., 2008). The sulfide may have been  introduced from external sources during upward movement and emplacement of parent magma. <br><br>\r\n\r\nAcknowledgments<br>\r\nThe authors are grateful to the Research Council of Shiraz University for financially supporting this study. <br><br>\r\n\r\nReferences<br>\r\nEdwards, S.J., Pearce, J.A. and Freeman, J., 2002.

While the criteria for line length has typically been highly prominent in orthography manuals, it is only found in the presented categorization on the sixth hierarchical level.\r\nAside from two new Unicode dash characters (the <i>two-em dash<\/i> and <i>three-em dash<\/i>, Unicode 6.1, January 2012) having been standardized in the meantime, differing methodology and a comparison of the linguistic-historical and computational linguistic aspects have spread awareness of dash characters in the Croatian language as described in Portada-Stojanov (2009). A categorization is presented that is sensitive to the dichotomy of graphic representation and meaning that divides all dash characters into five hierarchical levels. Among the 44 Unicode horizontal and unbroken dash characters, a division into type, time, functionality, direction, and line height has resulted in 11 contemporary Latin alphabetic horizontal central characters, among which each language written in the Latin alphabet chooses its own. The semantic value and usage of all Unicode dash graphemes has been described.\r\nOn the other hand, the paper also described dash characters from the perspective of Croatian historical linguistics and orthography. In comparison to the rich repository of standardized Unicode dash characters, it has been shown that orthographic standards are significantly reductive. Orthographic norming of dash characters is divided into two periods and three groups, depending on their graphemic form (the first and second generation of orthography manuals) and terminology (the pre-standard phase and the two standard norming schools, depending on the acceptance of the terminological pairs \u201cspojnica \u2013 crtica\u201d and \u201ccrtica \u2013 crta\u201d).\r\nThe historical linguistic and computational linguistic comparative research and the contrastive analysis of the Unicode standardization of dash characters with traditional orthographic descriptions of dash characters was intended to highlight (i) the need for a broader, interdisciplinary approach to describing written linguistic practice, (ii) the insufficiency of descriptions in primary and secondary school orthography manuals for modern writing, and (iii) the insufficiency of the existing Croatian codification of both terminological schools. In order for orthography manuals to be called scholarly, it is claimed that computer writing should be better described, and that a differentiation between characters and graphemes should be introduced on the level of punctuation. One of the areas in which orthography manuals could bring themselves technologically up to date is the issue of the writing of compound words at the beginning of a broken line, and the paper provides eight reasons to abandon the current tradition.\r\nAnalysis has shown that it would be justified to base dash codification on three or four characters, which reduces the 11 Latin Unicode characters to basic groups of dashes \u2013 the short, medium, long, and very long dashes, referred to as <i>c<sub>1<\/sub><\/i>, <i>c<sub>2<\/sub><\/i>, <i>c<sub>3<\/sub><\/i> and <i>c<sub>4<\/sub><\/i>.\r\n",

Analysis covered all the phenomena in the domain of expressive syntax based on deviation of usual sentence construction order caused by its simplification, i.e. intonation division and independence of the sentence parts: ellipse as a syntactic figure of deduction, nominative sentences considered subtype of ellipse, as well as incomplete statements presented through reticention. \r\nThis paper also highlights the relatively new phenomenon of expressive syntax \u2013 parceling, meaning realization of one sentence in more textual units, as one of the linguistic universality and very frequent mean of organizing statements in the language of modern writers.\r\nDeviation from principles of traditional sentence order by simplifying, keeping only the basic elements and making the parts of the sentence independent is targeted deviation, on purpose, through writer\u2019s intention to stylize its expression. Therefore, incomplete sentences analyzed in this paper could be considered important stylistic-expressive mean in the literary\/artistic texts where aesthetic language function has been put in the forefront.",

La distribuci\u00f3n de las puntuaciones obtenidas por los empleados de la constructora mostr\u00f3 que \u00e9stos tienden a percibirse como m\u00e1s competentes, mientras que los de las redes de supermercados como m\u00e1s cualificados\/integrados e identificados con objetivos y tradiciones de la empresa. Finalmente la relaci\u00f3n de las puntuaciones de los empleados con las t\u00e1cticas organizacionales adoptadas permiti\u00f3 concluir que la varianza en la auto-percepci\u00f3n de los empleados reflejan las diferencias de las t\u00e1cticas organizacionales entre las empresas.",

In the last ten years alone there were two new waves of accession, the EU launched the single currency and failed attempts have been made to introduce a constitution. With all these transformations taking place, attention is more and more centred on the question whether a European identity is emerging. This article investigates this issue examining comparativelythe patterns of national identity and of European identity formation and focusing on whether the relationship between the two is a zero-sum type. The aim is to show that although national identity is not necessarily an obstacle for the development of European identity, nationalism is.",

Patient characteristics including age, gender, and mode of presentation were collected. The success rate of unsedated colonoscopy was compared with the standard success rate of sedated colonoscopy in the literature.

Therefore, the monoethylglycinexylidide (MEGX) test, which provides a direct measure of the actual functional state of the liver, is proposed as a real-time liver function test. The objective of this study was to assess the prognostic value of the MEGX test in cirrhosis by comparing it with Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP), the Mayo end stage liver disease (MELD) and discriminant function (DF) scores. <b> Materials and Methods: <\/b> The study was carried out in Satara, India during the period of January 2005 to June 2006 and included 79 adult alcoholic cirrhotic patients. The serum specimen from each patient was analyzed using conventional LFTs and the MEGX test. The prognostic scores-CTP, MELD and DF scores were calculated and statistical analyses was performed. <b> Results: <\/b> Based on receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, the MELD score and MEGX<sub> 60<\/sub>  showed excellent sensitivity and specificity. The comparison of area under ROC curves showed that MELD and MEGX<sub> 60<\/sub>  had superior prognostic accuracy when compared to other scores. Kaplan-Meier survival curves for corresponding cutoff values clearly differentiated between patients with different survival times. <b> Conclusion: <\/b> The<b>  <\/b> MEGX test has shown more sensitivity, specificity and accuracy than CTP and DF scores in determining cases with the possibility of three- and six-month survival. Thus, it can be concluded that MEGX test alongwith MELD, is an effective prognostic tool in the hands of clinicians for predicting short-term survival.",

            "abstract": "A sistem\u00e1tica operativa das empresas construtoras apresenta v\u00e1rias singularidades, que devem ser levadas em considera\u00e7\u00e3o quando se planeja o Sistema de Informa\u00e7\u00e3o Cont\u00e1bil e, por extens\u00e3o, o Sistema de Apura\u00e7\u00e3o e An\u00e1lise de Custos destas Entidades Cont\u00e1beis. A quase totalidade das empresas construtoras trabalha no atendimento de encomendas. Para cada nova obra \u00e9 necess\u00e1rio redefinir todo o planejamento e programa\u00e7\u00e3o das opera\u00e7\u00f5es, incluindo o quadro de pessoal, deslocamento e reposicionamento dos equipamentos e m\u00e1quinas, e, n\u00e3o raro, tamb\u00e9m das equipes de venda. A maior parte dos materiais utilizados nas obras \u00e9 de alta densidade f\u00edsica e baixa densidade econ\u00f4mica, sendo mais conveniente estoc\u00e1-los diretamente no local onde ser\u00e3o consumidos (vale dizer, a obra), o que conduz a problemas log\u00edsticos de armazenamento, seguran\u00e7a e controle dos estoques. A perfeita evidencia\u00e7\u00e3o da fenomenologia gestiva das empresas construtoras exige que todas estas singularidades sejam devidamente consideradas no planejamento cont\u00e1bil dessas entidades, e de forma especial no seu sistema de custeamento. Os autores entendem que, para a Contabilidade, uma empresa construtora deve entendida como um Ilaparelho de produ\u00e7\u00e3o\", que pode ser mantido temporariamente em situa\u00e7\u00e3o de repouso, sem nada produzir nem vender, ou ser ativado e acelerado at\u00e9 o pleno emprego, N\u00edvel de Atividade (NdA) no qual o volume de produ\u00e7\u00e3o e\/ou das vendas conduz a que um ou mais dos fatores econ\u00f4micos dispon\u00edveis alcance sua utiliza\u00e7\u00e3o m\u00e1xima total. Quando estruturado na forma proposta pela Contabilidade Funcional, o Sistema de Informa\u00e7\u00e3o Cont\u00e1bil \u00e9 capaz de e\/evar simult\u00e2nea e independentemente os tr\u00eas efeitos ou aspectos dos atos gestivos; efeito Investimentos, efeito Resultados e efeito Liquidez. Igualmente, o Sistema de Informa\u00e7\u00e3o Cont\u00e1bil deve ser subdividido em dois subsistemas menores, o Sistema Cont\u00e1bil Formal e o Sistema Cont\u00e1bil Gerencial. O segundo tem a seu cargo c\u00e1lculos e estat\u00edsticas relacionados com a produ\u00e7\u00e3o e as vendas, o custeamento dos produtos (obras) e a or\u00e7amenta\u00e7\u00e3o. O mais importante instrumento de releva\u00e7\u00e3o utilizado pelo Sistema Cont\u00e1bil Gerencial \u00e9 o Sistema de Apura\u00e7\u00e3o e An\u00e1lise de Custos (SAAC). As caracter\u00edsticas da produ\u00e7\u00e3o e as singularidades dos produtos exsumidos e comercializados pelas empresas construtoras exigem que o custeamento seja conduzido de forma a permitir uma evidencia\u00e7\u00e3o multidimensional dos custos. Conseq\u00fcentemente, a Contabilidade Interna (Contabilidade Gerencial) dever\u00e1 ser estruturada de forma a permitir uma avalia\u00e7\u00e3o multidimensional, semelhante \u00e0 proposta pela Estrat\u00e9gia de Ataque Tr\u00edplice, proposta por Robert Koehler em 1991. No caso das empresas construtoras, os instrumentos de custeamento mais aconselh\u00e1veis s\u00e3o o Custeamento Direto, para orienta\u00e7\u00e3o do planejamento log\u00edstico, uma t\u00e9cnica de planejamento e custeamento baseado em grafos sagitais, como o CPM (Custeamento por Caminho Cr\u00edtico) para orienta\u00e7\u00e3o do planejamento t\u00e1tico, e o Custeamento Baseado em Oportunidades para orienta\u00e7\u00e3o e apoio do planejamento estrat\u00e9gico.",

Studies have shown that group cognitive behavioral theory (CBT) is safe and effective treatment for depression among menopausal women; however, only limited studies are conducted in India. Aims: To examine the efficacy of group CBT for depression among menopausal woman. Settings and Design: A randomized, controlled trial design was adopted with longitudinal measurement of outcomes for 6 months. The study was conducted from January 2017 to November 2017 at selected Primary Health Centre (PHC) area, urban Bengaluru. Subject and Methods: Participants were 80 women from selected PHC areas, Bengaluru, India. The participants were randomly assigned to either the experimental or control group by computer-generated random numbers. The experimental group received six weekly group CBT sessions. Depression was evaluated for both groups at the baseline and at two follow-up assessments in the 1st and 6th month. Treatment effects of the group CBT were analyzed by repeated-measures analysis of variance. Statistical Analysis Used: Data were analyzed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences software package (Version 23). Results: The results showed that comparisons of depression scores between the two groups before initiating group CBT were not significant. Statistically significant reduction in depression scores were seen among experimental group compared to control group over the 6-month period. Conclusion: This study concluded that group CBT is effective for reducing depression among menopausal woman.",

            "abstract": "Context and Aims: This study was carried out to assess quality of life (QoL) of tuberculosis patients receiving treatment from DOTS centres, to find out its change with treatment, and to ascertain its determinants. Materials and Methods: An institution based follow-up study was conducted in Bagbazar Urban Health District (UHD), Kolkata where all the tuberculosis patients registered within 1st 4 months of data collection were followed up for their current course of treatment. Quality of Life (QoL) was assessed using SF36v2 questionnaire at the start of treatment and after continuation phase (CP) (within 14 days). Statistical Analysis Used: General Linear Model was used to assess the predictors of change of QoL with treatment. Results: 61.4% and 16.4% patients were at the risk of depression at the start and end of their TB treatment respectively. Patient's per-capita monthly Income (PCI) and current smoking status interacted with time to predict trends in the Physical component scores. Similarly, PCI and educational status interacted with time to predict trends in the mental component scores. PCI and unemployment were found to be predictor of differences of Physical and mental component scores (between subject effects) respectively. Conclusions: QoL assessment in different stages of treatment should be incorporated in the ongoing RNTCP to make the programme more client-oriented and comprehensive, and to provide social support to those who need it most. Directly observed treatment should be supplemented with economic support, de-addiction campaign and Inter-personal counselling by the DOTS providers.",

            "abstract": "Background: Adolescent age group as school going children who experience a period of accelerated growth and development of skeletal and soft tissue. Any daily physical stresses external forces such as load carrying may also influence alignment of the human body. It is assumed that daily intermittent abnormal postural adaptations could result in pain and disability. Objectives: To know the effect of backpack loading on cervical and sagittal shoulder posture (SSP) in standing and after dynamic activity in school going children. Materials and Methods: The research project was conducted after getting clearance from Human Research Ethics Committee of the H M Patel Institution for Education and research center. Study was conducted on 160 school going children, and measurement were taken to know the loading over the cervical region along with their bagpacks were weighed. Results: Total 160 students were enrolled in the present study. Study found that average value of the subject's body weight was 34.83 kg, and subjects backpack weight was 6.42 kg that was equivalent to 18% of the subject's body weight. The mean value of cranio-vertebral angle (CVA) without school bag was 40.62. The mean values of cranio-horizontal angle (CHA) while standing with 18% of body weight and after dynamic activities with 18% of body weight were 24.51 \u00b1 10.3 and 28.93 \u00b1 4.34, respectively. The mean value of SSP without school bag was 39.39 \u00b1 4.31, whereas the mean values of SSP while standing with 18% of body weight and after dynamic activities with 18% of body weight were 54.38 \u00b1 21.19 and 77.62 \u00b1 17.50, respectively. Conclusions: Study revealed that there is a significant reduction in the CVA (or increased forward head position), increase in CHA, and SSP were found while carrying a backpack weight 18% of body weight over both shoulders.",

            "abstract": "Introduction: Cholera, though a preventable and treatable disease, is still regarded as an important public health problem in developing countries including India. Migration, unhygienic living conditions, overcrowding, open field defecation, and ignorance about the spread of disease are the major reasons for the occurrence of cholera in the slum areas. Cholera was detected in the stool sample of a 3-year-old child from a slum area of urban Wardha, which demanded an urgent outbreak investigation to be carried out before it progressed into an epidemic. Materials and Methods: This was a cross-sectional epidemiological study, where we have used pretested, predesigned epidemiological case sheets obtained from IDSP. A case definition was proposed before beginning the investigation. Linelisting, collection of stool and water samples, immediate referral, and treatment of the patients suffering from loose stool and\/or vomiting were performed. A detailed epidemiological report was made with recommendations and plan of action that was forwarded to the district health system. Results: In all, 28 suspected cases of cholera were line listed. Among the affected population, more than half of the suspected cases were from the age group of 0\u201310 years of age. Males were more affected when compared with females. The overall attack rate was 27% and case fatality rate was 0%. There was positive history of travel in the index case. Two of the water samples were found to be unsatisfactory for drinking. Conclusion: The investigation report was soon developed and shared with the district health authorities, and recommendations were given to prevent such outbreaks in future.",

            "abstract": "Background: Family planning (FP) programme has been integrated since long with MCH programme in order to reduce maternal and child mortality. The period of pregnancy, delivery, and postnatal period is very crucial to sensitize the women to adopt contraceptive practice because during this time they are in constant contact with health provider and more receptive to advice. The present study is designed in this context to see whether the utilization of maternal health services have any impact on adoption of modern contraceptives in extended postpartum period. Materials and Methods: Community-based cross-sectional study was done in urban slum of Jamnagar, Gujarat, for 1 year in 2016. Two-stage sampling methodology was used; in first stage, 30 Anganwadi centres (AWC) was chosen by systemic random sampling and in second stage from each AWC, 8 women in extended postpartum period were included. Study included total 240 women. Sampling was done at household level. Descriptive statistics for sociodemographic factors and reproductive characteristics were done. Chi-square test was used to find association between different variables. Result: Prevalence of using modern contraceptive was only 24.6%. The most preferred choice was barrier method (35.5%), followed by sterilization (27.1%), Intrauterine device (IUD) (25.04%), and OCP (12%). Around 57% women had taken \u22654 health center visit during their last pregnancy and 7.5% had never visited or consulted. 12% women were delivered at home. Majority of the participants (63.5%) were not paid visit by health worker, only 15% were provided with adequate postnatal visit and 21% had inadequate visit during their immediate postpartum period. A statistical association was found between usage of contraceptive with health center visit during ANC, postnatal visit by HW, parity and age of women in extended postpartum period. Conclusion: There is need to improve the quality of maternal health services to increase the utilization of FP services.",

            "abstract": "The development of the Slovak standard language in its modern history (the 20th century) is accompanied with polemics and alternation of purist and assimilation efforts conditioned by language planning in the range of political ideology. The efforts are primarily focused on Czech language influence on Slovak and they are manifested in an acceptance and support of the Czech influence on one hand and the prescriptive delimitation of the Slovak language on the other hand. The paper focuses on the period of the 1950\u2019s and 1960\u2019s, which is characterised by two opposite approaches: 1) a conscious and politically supported convergence of Slovak and Czech in the end of the 1950\u2019s and beginning of the 1960\u2019s and a refusing of any kind of purism in regulation of the language development, and 2) a rise of purist approaches and efforts to protect the Slovak standard language from Czech interferences in the middle of the 1960\u2019s. A corpus planning discourse of this period, which is analysed in this article, reflects the interconnection between political ideology and language regulation and it represents an exclusive source for sociolinguistic investigation.",

The influence of other linguistic categories (countability, definiteness, specificity) on word formation, the options available, as well as on the use of possessive word forms is also studied.\r\nThe paper determines the bearers of possessiveness as [+ living] nouns or as nouns which changed their actual [- living] feature into the linguistic [+ living] feature.

            "abstract": "<i>Gender-sensitive language<\/i>, <i>gender-neutral language<\/i>, <i>gender-inclusive language<\/i>, <i>gender-free language<\/i> and <i>gender-fair language<\/i> are terms used in English to refer to the usage of a tactful and respectful selection of vocabulary devoid of unfounded, unfair and discriminatory reference to women in contrast with men. Sport as a global social phenomenon strives for effort, excellence, fair play, solidarity and respect for all, and tries, among other things connected with these principles, to implement gender-fair policy throughout its domains, language included. The aim of this research was to analyse, both diachronically and synchronically, the usage of gender-fair language in competitive sport as well as in the scientific journals addressing sport and exercise-related topics. To realize the aim of this research, several relevant sources were inspected. As for competitive sport, first the texts of the Olympic Charter (the name is generally used in reference to all the editions) were analysed from its first edition in the English language, besides French, published in 1930 up to the latest edition published in 2015. Secondly, the set of nine documents published by the International Olympic Committee was scrutinized in terms of gender-fair vocabulary both with respect to diachrony and synchrony of their usage. Thirdly, the set of seven documents published by sports governing bodies were investigated to find out whether they abide by the principle of using gender-fair language. Further, names of sporting events and terms designating a person or persons participating in a sporting event were explored. As regards scientific inquiry, to analyse the policy of abiding by the same principle, i.e. by the principle of using non-discriminatory language in scholarly writing, a set of scientific journals that publish articles whose topics are sport-related was selected. The <i>Web of Science Core Collection \u2013 Science Citation Index Expanded<\/i>, an example of a relevant and a highly valued database in which a multitude of scientific publications \u2013 sport-related in terms of their topic as well \u2013 are indexed, was searched to look into the word choice used to talk about women and men in sport. The analysis has shown that special attention is paid to using genderfair language both in competitive sport and in scientific writing. Although evidence revealed that in some cases gender-fair language is either inconsistently used or better solutions should be sought, sport is indisputably a domain which strives to follow a policy aimed at developing equal opportunities for women and men \u2013 using gender-fair language being one of the ways to corroborate this endeavour.",

Taking into account the linguistic tradition and musicology heritage as well as contemporary usage, user needs and functional criteria of the special field is the basis for the standardization of basic musical terminology within the research project Conmusterm. The paper discusses key terminological issues in the Croatian music terminology on the examples from expert pedagogical literature and the curricula for primary and secondary music education. Special attention is paid to the specific features of the music terminology, such as diachronic polysemy and the resistance of a part of the terminology to assimilation, where it is necessary to abandon the generally accepted terminological principles.",

The theory encompasses bibliography of papers focusing on Slavonian dialect, and the practice deals with the activities used for teaching and promoting the dialect. While forming the viewpoint on the Slavonian dialect, taking care of what will remain for the younger generations, we have to keep in mind the diversity of regional and local speeches, as well as add the sociolinguistic, the cultural and the identity to the scientific view \u2013 that is the only way to consider the local language a constituent part of national and regional identity. A separate part of the paper consists of bibliographical units list for the period from 2000 to 2015 that can be a starting point for the complete bibliography of works on Slavonian dialect.",

The area of Postcolonial studies has been recognized by New musicology as a possible starting point for theorizing the new issues related to the questions of music, race, ethnic and national otherness, and European colonialism. In 1991, with the publication of Ralph P. Locke\u2019s text \u201cConstructing the Oriental \u2018Other\u2019: Saint-Sa\u00ebns\u2019s Samson et Dalila\u201d in Cambridge Opera Journal, the musicological research of the European professional music tradition from the aspects of postcolonial theories has been institutionalized and the concept of Orientalism has been introduced into the field of research objects of musicology. What is present as the common aspects of all musicological studies that address the issue of musical representations of the Orient are interdisciplinarity and contextuality. Contrary to the reduction of the complex Western European music practices to the idea of an autonomous work of music devoted to an aesthetic enjoyment, postcolonial musicology proposed poststructuralist analytical models of text and discourse and affirm the interest in the context of work of music. In that manner, musicology has been updated as a discipline that autocritically approaches Western European professional music practice by seeing it\/ self as only one of the possible historical formations of culture\/knowledge in which there are visible clusters, conflicts, and aspirations to present (Western) European capitalist patriarchal politics as a universal economic, political and cultural power.",

Earlier, this non-indigenous species was reported from the Godavari River in the Nasik district of Maharashtra state of India although there was confusion on the presence of Planorbella scalaries and Planorbella duryi. Occurrence of P. duryi, has been confirmed along with distribution, ecology, and probable dispersal hypothesis has been discussed.\r\n",

            "abstract": "One of the most notable challenges in wireless communications is energy scarcity, which has attracted considerable attention in Fifth Generation (5G) wireless network research. This paper investigates the performance of energy harvesting (EH) relays under the best relay selection (BRS) scheme. The results show degradation of spectral efficiency (SE) due to EH relaying compared with conventional cooperative relaying (CR). Conversely, EH relaying provides a positive gain compared with conventional CR, increasing the lifetime of the network and decreasing energy consumption (EC) and operational cost. Moreover, the EH relaying network has better energy efficiency (EE) compared with conventional relaying networks. Results show that when EH relaying is applied, EE is improved through an increased number of relays. Finally, the SE-EE metric is presented for both conventional and EH relays. Results show that the performance of the proposed technique was able to achieve a maximum SE of 1.4 bits\/s\/Hz and maximum EE at 0.6 bits\/s\/Hz, and for the case of conventional relays, a maximum SE of 2 bits\/s\/Hz and EE at 1.1 bits\/s\/Hz. This result implies that the proposed EH scheme provides an optimum solution for energy-constrained wireless CR systems.",

            "abstract": "Tumor&ndash;stroma interactions are of key importance for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) progression. Our aim was to investigate whether cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and mast cells (MC) affected the sensitivity of PDAC cells to gemcitabine\/nabpaclitaxel (GEM\/NAB). For this purpose, the combination cytotoxicity and the effect on tumor invasion and angiogenesis were evaluated with or without a conditioned medium from the mast cell line HMC-1 (human mast cell line-1 cells) and CAFs. Beside the clinical outcome of a homogenous population of PDAC patients, receiving GEM\/NAB, was correlated to the circulating levels of mast cell tryptase and to a panel of inflammatory and immunosuppressive cytokines. CAFs neither affected drugs&rsquo; cytotoxicity nor the inhibition of angiogenesis, but promoted tumor cell invasion. The MC instead, caused resistance to drugs by reducing apoptosis, by activating the TGF-&beta; signalling and by promoting tumor invasion. Indeed, the inhibition of T&beta;RI serine\/threonine kinase activity by galunisertib restored drugs cytotoxicity. Moreover, MC induced the release of TGF-&beta;1, and increased expression of PAR-2, ERK1\/2 and Akt activation. Accordingly, TGF-&beta;1, tryptase and other pro-inflammatory and immunosuppressive cytokines increased in the unresponsive patients. In conclusion, MC play a pivotal role in the resistance to GEM\/NAB. A correlation between high level of circulating pro-inflammatory\/ immunosuppressive cytokines and unresponsiveness was found in PDAC patients.",

With the aim of obtaining comprehensive information on the rationalized selection of adsorbents for heat storage in open sorption systems operating in the moist-air flow mode, various materials reported up to now in the literature are reviewed by referring strictly to the possible mechanisms of water vapour adsorption, as well as practical aspects of their preparation or their application under particular operating conditions. It seems reasonable to suggest that, on the basis of the current state-of-the-art, the adsorption phenomenon may be rather exploited in the auxiliary heating systems, which provide additional heat during winter&rsquo;s coldest days.",

            "abstract": "This paper addresses the waveform design problem of cognitive radar for extended target estimation in the presence of signal-dependent clutter, subject to a peak-to-average power ratio (PAR) constraint. Owing to this kind of constraint and the convolution operation of the waveform in the time domain, the formulated optimization problem for maximizing the mutual information (MI) between the target and the received signal is a complex non-convex problem. To this end, an efficient waveform design method based on minimization&ndash;maximization (MM) technique is proposed. First, by using the MM approach, the original non-convex problem is converted to a convex problem concerning the matrix variable. Then a trick is used for replacing the matrix variable with the vector variable by utilizing the properties of the Toeplitz matrix. Based on this, the optimization problem can be solved efficiently combined with the nearest neighbor method. Finally, an acceleration scheme is used to improve the convergence speed of the proposed method. The simulation results illustrate that the proposed method is superior to the existing methods in terms of estimation performance when designing the constrained waveform.",

            "abstract": "Background: Prostate cancer is the second-leading cause of cancer death among men in the world. This cancer has increased significantly during recent years in Iran and is the sixth most common malignancy in Iranian men. Survival rates for prostate cancer in Iran are unknown. The present study aimed to estimate survival of patients suffering from prostate cancer in Yazd, Iran.\n\nMethods: In this retrospective cohort study, data were collected from 100 men with prostate cancer registered in Shohadaye Kargar and Shahid Sadoughy hospitals in Yazd during the period 2001-2012. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate the survival over time and Cox regression analysis was performed to calculate the hazard ratios according to demographic and risk variables.\n\nResults: The mean age of all patients was 74.4 years. They had a mean survival time of 70.78\u00b14.94 month. The 1-year, 3-year, and 5-year survival rates were 97%, 73%, and 54%, respectively. A statistically significant correlation was found between age, tumor grade, cancer stage, treatment and survival time of patients (p<0.05). The worst survival was in men with Gleason score 8-10 and stage IV of prostate cancer. Data showed no significant association between place of residence and patients' survival (p>0.05).\n\nConclusion: In this study, 5-year survival of patients with prostate cancer was poor. Screening of men for cancer diagnosis in early stages and use of advanced treatment option, it seems to improve survival outcome. Further studies are needed to monitor the survival of patients with prostate cancer in Iran.",

The 2.4 ha experimental area, located at the Experimental Station of the Federal University of Campina Grande, in Santa Terezinha, Para\u00edba State, Brazil, was divided into four 0.6 ha paddocks, which were further subdivided into two 0.3 ha experimental plots. Twelve F1 (Boer x SRD) goats and 12 Santa In\u00eas sheep were divided in four groups of six animals of the same species. The herbaceous vegetation was separated into buffel grass (<em>Cenchrus ciliaris<\/em> L.), dicotyledons and other grass species. Treatments were randomized to plots according to a completely random design with two treatments, four replications, with measures repeated in time (July\/1, Aug\/1, Sept\/1 and Oct\/1. Buffel grass dry mater (DM) availability was higher in the sheep grazed than in the goat-grazed area. Buffel grass DM supply did not change from July to September, while dicotyledons DM supply decreased. Grazing affected availability, accumulation rate and supply of the forage produced (DM basis) by dicotyledonous herbs. Buffel grass forage availability was not affected during the experimental period.<\/p>",

Underlying micro-data for firms and institutions in the biotech sector together with information on their research collaboration partners have been extracted from a commercial industry directory, the BIOCOM Year and Address book, for 2005 and 2009. The data have been processed and aggregated to the level of NUTS3 regions. This core data set has been linked to regional covariates which measure the regional endowment with biotech-related research capacities, sector-specific S&T policy support and the strength of a region\u05f3s overall local innovation system. The full data set, which is attached to this article, offers applied researchers an alternative source of information for empirical analyses of knowledge flows in research networks and for studying their determinants. Potential fields of application include social network and regression analysis. First empirical results are reported in \u201cDetermining factors of interregional research collaboration in Germany\u05f3s biotech network: Capacity, proximity, policy?\u201d (Mitze and Strotebeck, 2018)\u00a0and \u201cCentrality and get-richer mechanisms in interregional knowledge networks\u201d (Mitze and Strotebeck, 2018).

Vesicular transport related proteins of C. sinensis were predicted by (i) finding orthologues based on previously described vesicular transport proteins and (ii) GO term enrichment analysis. Based on the protein content different types of intra and intercellular vesicles were dissected and the distribution of different Enzyme classes (ECs) were determined.

The edible part of fruits is white and reddish arillodes in which having sweet to acid-sweet tastes. However, nucleotide as well as transcriptome information of this species is still scarce, no information has been deposited in GenBank. In this data article, we performed for the first time of de novo assembly of transcriptome using paired-end Illumina technology. The assembled contigs were constructed using Trinity and after filtering and clustering, produced 37,077 contigs. The contig ranged 201\u20134972\u202fbp and N50 has 696\u202fbp. The contig was annotated with several database such as SwissProt, TrEMBL, nr and nt NCBI databases. The raw reads were deposited in DDBJ with DRA numbers, DRA007358. The assembled contigs of transcriptome are deposited in the DDBJ TSA with accession number, IADP01000001\u2013IADP01037077 and also can be accessed at http:\/\/rujakbase.id.",

However, the transcriptomic study of rambutan has limited. In this study, we performed transcriptome assembly using paired-end Illumina technology. The assembled transcriptome was constructed using Trinity and after filtering and removal sequences redundancy produced 36,303 contigs. The contig ranged 201\u201311,770\u202fbp and N50 has 1327\u202fbp. The contig was annotated with several databases such as SwissProt, TrEMBL, and nr\/nt of NCBI databases. The raw reads are deposited in the DDBJ with DRA accession number, DRA007359: https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/sra\/?term=DRA007359.

Data reports the change in the emission peak of ADIFAB and in the affinity for FFA as a function of pH. An algorithm based on spectral deconvolution allowed to correct ADIFAB fluorescence spectra for the spectroscopic effect caused by pH. Kd values were calculated at each pH based on a calibration with oleic acid. This method allows estimating FFA concentration by ADIFAB in media at different pH. The current data are related to the research article \u201cPhospholipid components of the synthetic pulmonary surfactant CHF5633 probed by fluorescence spectroscopy\u201d (Faggiano et al., 2018) [1].",

Python is probably the ideal glue language to write applications that exploit the capabilities of modern graphic cards through the Open Graphics Library. A brief introduction to Python and OpenGL will preface our approach in writing easily reusable code to create a Python package to represent vector fields through particles that move along the flow lines of the field at a speed and color proportional to its modulus. An example application will be shown to illustrate how interactive control of speed, color and number of animated particles is possible as the whole rendering process happens in the GPU in real time. A background image can be shown to add information for the interpretation of the results. Keywords: Python, OpenGL, Vector field, Animation",

Some strains adapted to this particular niche show distinct phenotypes, such as biofilm hyperproduction. It is necessary to study CF clinical P. aeruginosa isolates, such as Liverpool Epidemic Strains (LES), to acquire a better understanding of the key genes essential for in vivo maintenance and the major virulence mechanisms involved in CF lung infections. Previously, a library of 9216 mutants of the LESB58 strain were generated by signature-tagged mutagenesis (STM) and screened in the rat model of chronic lung infection, allowing the identification of 163 STM mutants showing defects in in vivo maintenance. Results In the present study, these 163 mutants were successively screened in two additional surrogate host models (the amoeba and the fruit fly). The STM PALES_11731 mutant was the unique non-virulent in the three hosts. A competitive index study in rat lungs confirmed that the mutant was 20-fold less virulent than the wild-type strain. This study demonstrated the pertinence to use a multi-host approach to study the genetic determinants of P. aeruginosa strains infecting CF patients.",

It is developed to facilitate the analysis and structural design of beams and girders with advanced construction materials like ultra-high performance concrete (UHPC), high strength steel rebars and\/or large prestressing strands. MC-BAM supports several existing, recently developed, or user-defined constitutive material models that can be applied to rectangular, circular, or other cross-sections such as I- or Pi-girders. The material models and section analysis algorithm are verified, first for conventional materials against commercial software and textbook examples, then for different cross-sections with advanced materials and designs against published experimental results.

It can compute the intensity distributions at a desired plane from the DOE. This software can also convert the phase profiles of the DOEs from standard image formats such as JPG and PNG to lithography graphic format GDSII for fabrication purposes. The conversion algorithm used in this program groups adjacent same-valued pixels and creates a single cell rather than creating a cell for each and every pixel in the image file. This results in a faster and smaller output GDSII file size. Conversion to the multi-layer GDSII format is also possible for grayscale lithography. We show, as an example, the simulation, GDSII conversion, fabrication and experimental results for the case of an Airy beam generator. GDoeSII offers a complete platform for researchers working in diffractive optics from simulations to lithography file preparation. Keywords: Diffractive optics, Image to GDSII conversion, Python",

The pilot trial aimed to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of a web-delivered weight loss intervention for postnatal women and associated trial protocol. Results General practice database searches revealed low rates of eligible postnatal women per practice. 16 (10%) of the 168 identified women were recruited and randomised, seven to the intervention and nine to the control. 57% (4\/7) of the intervention women completed 3\u00a0month follow-up measurements in comparison to 56% (5\/9) in the control group. By 12\u00a0months, retention in the intervention group was 43% (3\/7), with 2\/7 women active on the website, in comparison to 44% (4\/9) of the control group. Interview findings revealed the web as an acceptable method for delivery of the intervention, with the suggestion of an addition of a mobile application. Alternative recruitment strategies, using health visitor appointments, midwifery departments or mother and baby\/toddler groups, should be explored. Greater involvement of potential users should enable better recruitment methods to be developed. Trial registration ISRCTN: ISRCTN48086713, Registered 26 October 2012",

            "abstract": "Background: Activation of autocrine VEGF-VEGFR2 signalling in tumour cells activates cell proliferation, survival, and angiogenesis, all of which are crucial for tumour progression. Ovarian cancer-associated antigen 66 (OVA66) is now known to be overexpressed in multiple tumours and plays a role in tumour development, but the underlying mechanisms has not been fully investigated. Methods: We employed ovarian and cervical cancer cells and mouse models to detect the role of OVA66 in angiogenesis, growth, and metastasis of cancer cells. Immunofluorescence and western blot were used to determine the function of OVA66 in regulating autocrine VEGF-VEGFR2 signalling. Immunohistochemistry and bioinformatics analysis were used to detect the correlation of OVA66 and VEGF expression. Findings: OVA66 overexpression in the cancer cell lines promoted VEGF secretion, tumour growth and angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo. Conversely, shRNA-mediated OVA66 knockdown had the opposite effects. Mechanistically, OVA66 overexpression was found to boost an autocrine VEGF\u2013VEGFR2 positive-feedback signalling loop in the tumour cells, leading to amplified effect of VEGF on tumour angiogenesis and proliferation and increased migration in vitro and in vivo, respectively. Finally, we identified a significant positive correlation between the expression levels of OVA66 and VEGF in ovarian and cervical cancer specimens, and found that OVA66 was significantly associated with advanced ovarian cancer. Interpretation: We identify a novel function for OVA66 in regulating an autocrine VEGF\u2013VEGFR2 feed-forward signalling loop that promotes tumour progression and angiogenesis. Fund: This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (81602262); and Excellent Youth Scholar Program of Tongji University (2015KJ062).

            "abstract": "Aim: In Vibrio parahaemolyticus, the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)-associated cas6 endoribonuclease gene has been shown to exhibit sequence diversity and has been subtyped into four major types based on its length and composition. In this study, we aimed to detect and characterize the cas6 gene variants prevalent among V. parahaemolyticus strains isolated from seafoods and environment.\r\n\r\nMaterials and Methods: Novel primers were designed for each of the cas6 subtypes to validate their identification in V. parahaemolyticus by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). In total, 38 V. parahaemolyticus strains isolated from seafoods and environment were screened for the presence of cas6 gene. Few representative PCR products were sequenced, and their phylogenetic relationship was established to available cas6 gene sequences in GenBank database.\r\n\r\nResults: Of the 38 V. parahaemolyticus isolates screened, only about 40% of strains harbored the cas6 endoribonuclease gene, among which 31.6% and 7.9% of the isolates were positive for the presence of the cas6-a and cas6-d subtypes of the gene, respectively. The subtypes cas6-b and cas6-c were absent in strains studied. Sequence and phylogenetic analysis also established the cas6 sequences in this study to match GenBank sequences for cas6-a and cas6-d subtypes.\r\n\r\nConclusion: In V. parahaemolyticus, the Cas6 endoribonuclease is an associated protein of the CRISPR-cas system. CRISPR-positive strains exhibited genotypic variation for this gene. Primers designed in this study would aid in identifying the cas6 genotype and understanding the role of these genotypes in the CRISPR-cas immune system of the pathogen.",

            "abstract": "Researches on road extraction from digital images are not recent, being the first one from 70's. The methods developed are usually classified into two classes, i.e., semi-automatic and automatic. Concerning this last class, no intervention with the operator is expected. In this context, the road crossing extraction is fundamental, although very few works are found in the relevant literature. The main reason is the great diversity of road crossings, bringing some difficulties to build up a priori knowledge of them. This research proposes a methodology for solving this problem combining road segments extracted from a high - resolution image (pixel < 0.7 m), with lines extracted from a low - resolution image (pixel > 2m) resampled from the original, high - resolution image. The proposed methodology was tested with a set of high - resolution image, showing that it is reliable and efficient. Whenever the road edges were well - defined the method was able to totally extract the road crossings. In addition it provided road networks with completion significantly better (about 20%) than the corresponding ones previously extracted by the automatic road segment extraction method.",

            "abstract": "This article proposes a novel road extraction methodology from digital aerial images. The innovation is based on the dynamic programming (DP) algorithm to carry out the optimization process in the object space, instead of doing it in the image space such as the DP traditional methodologies. The basic principle is inspired on the photogrammetric plotter functioning. In both cases, the features are traced in the object space, which implies that a rigorous mathematical model is necessary to establish a relationship between image and object space points. However, the proposed methodology does not require the operator to compile the features in the object space. It just requires that the operator measures a few seed points in the image space to describe sparsely and coarsely the roads, which must be transformed into the object space to make possible the initialization of the dynamic programming optimization process. Flexibility is one of the most important advantages of the proposed methodology, that can be operated in different modes (mono-plotting or stereo-plotting), and with several image types, including multisensor images. This paper presents the basics of the novel methodology for road extraction in the object space, as well as the details of the semi-automatic road extraction process using a single image, along with the experimental results.",

            "abstract": "There is a great amount of altimetry data collected by several experiments taken in the Tapaj\u00f3s National Forest located in the Brazilian Amazon State of Par\u00e1. Some of these data were produced by current state of the art technology whose effectiveness is still being proven by scientific investigations. In 1999 LIDAR profiles associated to videography data were taken in the region. In 2000 it was collected P and X band interferometric multifrequency data over areas of different vegetation types. The backscatter response collected by P band radar antenna potentially produces a real digital terrain model (DTM) due to its penetration capability across forest canopy toward the soil. When collected in X band radiation is reflected in the top forest canopy which produces a digital surface model (DSM). The availability of digital terrain model and digital surface model covering the same forested area is of great interest for many purposes, especially cartographic applications and carbon stock estimation. Also in 2000, the SRTM mission provided global interferometric cover in C and X bands that permitted the use of these data in the present work. In 2001, 2002, 2003 e 2005 several field control positions were surveyed using GPS dual frequency receivers and by topography surveying methods using total stations. The purpose of this work is to make an evaluation of the errors affecting the original multiple sensor data collected in the study area and apply an effective correction in order to eliminate those errors to permit using the models in other applications. An effective correction type was developed that reduced the original errors. The correction methodology consisted in altimetry offset determination and its application to the original data. Evaluations confirmed that the correction methodology produced good results and the corrected models presented global and local errors lesser than those in the original models.",

Para cada ponto de refer\u00eancia das classes de cobertura agricultura, floresta, pastagem e silvicultura, foram geradas s\u00e9ries temporais ruidosas para cada n\u00edvel de ru\u00eddo (10%, 40% e 70%). O desempenho dos filtros foi comparado segundo o erro padr\u00e3o encontrado. Os valores de RMSE dos filtros foram pr\u00f3ximos para os tr\u00eas n\u00edveis de ru\u00eddo. Nas simula\u00e7\u00f5es de 10% e 40% de ru\u00eddo, o menor erro foi para o filtro de mediana e o segundo menor para o filtro 4253H twice. Para a simula\u00e7\u00e3o com 70% de ru\u00eddo, o menor erro foi para o filtro de m\u00e9dia, o segundo para o filtro de mediana e o terceiro para o 4253H twice.

A metodologia consistiu na realiza\u00e7\u00e3o de revis\u00e3o da literatura e an\u00e1lise dos SIG disponibilizados nos s\u00edtios eletr\u00f4nicos dos Tribunais de Contas.

Verifcou-se que 35,7% dos Tribunais utilizavam SIG de forma sistem\u00e1tica, 14,3% estavam em fase de estudos e 50,0% ainda n\u00e3o utilizavam. Como possibilidade de novas aplica\u00e7\u00f5es nas auditorias, apontam-se GNSS diferencial e sensoriamento remoto para confer\u00eancia de medi\u00e7\u00f5es e aplica\u00e7\u00f5es de SIG para controle a dist\u00e2ncia de obras por meio de sensoriamento remoto, integra\u00e7\u00e3o de bases de dados existentes e an\u00e1lises espaciais.",

            "abstract": "Atualmente \u00e9 grande a preocupa\u00e7\u00e3o com o desmatamento das \u00e1reas tropicais, em particular na Amaz\u00f4nia, e sua in\u00ef\u00ac\u201au\u00eancia no clima. H\u00e1 alguns anos v\u00eam sendo realizados experimentos de campo envolvendo coletas cont\u00ednuas de dados relacionados \u00e0s trocas de energia e CO2 entre a superf\u00edcie e a atmosfera na regi\u00e3o amaz\u00f4nica. No entanto, as medidas obtidas por esses experimentos s\u00e3o geralmente representativas de pequenas \u00e1reas. Este estudo tem como objetivo apresentar e discutir alguns dos principais modelos desenvolvidos para estimativa dos \u00ef\u00ac\u201auxos energ\u00e9ticos na superf\u00edcie e CO2 mediante dados de sat\u00e9lite, ressaltando as potencialidades e limita\u00e7\u00f5es de aplica\u00e7\u00e3o na regi\u00e3o amaz\u00f4nica. De modo geral, os algoritmos de \u00ef\u00ac\u201auxos de energia utilizam imagens nas regi\u00f5es do vis\u00edvel e infravermelho (pr\u00f3ximo e termal) e s\u00e3o baseados em m\u00e9todos emp\u00edricos e f\u00edsicos. As vari\u00e1veis in situ necess\u00e1rias correspondem \u00e0 temperatura do ar e velocidade do vento, e as maiores incertezas est\u00e3o na determina\u00e7\u00e3o dos \u00ef\u00ac\u201auxos de calor no solo e sens\u00edvel. Por sua vez, os modelos de \u00ef\u00ac\u201auxos de CO2 baseiam-se nos espectros do vis\u00edvel e infravermelho pr\u00f3ximo, sendo alicer\u00e7ados no conceito de e\u00ef\u00ac\u0081ci\u00eancia de uso da radia\u00e7\u00e3o (RUE). O maior desa\u00ef\u00ac\u0081o est\u00e1 justamente na de\u00ef\u00ac\u0081ni\u00e7\u00e3o do termo de RUE para distintos ecossistemas, e a informa\u00e7\u00e3o b\u00e1sica de campo refere-se \u00c3\u00a0 radia\u00e7\u00e3o solar. Em suma, o uso de algoritmos baseados em imagens de sat\u00e9lite possui um importante papel no entendimento espacial e temporal de par\u00e2metros biof\u00edsicos da superf\u00edcie em uma regi\u00e3o onde a maioria das informa\u00e7\u00f5es s\u00e3o geradas pontualmente. Os dados gerados podem ser utilizados para alimentar modelos de superf\u00edcie acoplados aos modelos de circula\u00e7\u00e3o geral da atmosfera, permitindo, entre outros, avaliar o impacto, em \u00e2mbito regional e global, causado por mudan\u00e7as de uso\/ cobertura da terra.",

            "abstract": "The accurate use of satellite images for mapping and environmental monitoring requires the image transformation to ground reflectance through atmospheric correction. However, it is a challenge to obtain the horizontal visibility, which is used by the atmospheric correction models to estimate the aerosol optical depth. The aim of this paper is to present the comparison of atmospheric correction of OLI Landsat 8 images using horizontal visibility from field observation and from airport data. OLI images were acquired from four dates, 02\/26\/2014, 02\/10\/2014, 10\/11\/2015 and 04\/20\/2016. Field work was conducted at the same time of satellite overpass and horizontal visibility was obtained by observing targets at different distances and recording the maximum distance at which targets could be identifiable by visual inspection yielding values from 12 to 17 km. For comparison the horizontal visibility was also downloaded from METAR database for the Gale\u00e3o airport, which were up to 10km. Atmospheric correction was carried out for the two sources of horizontal visibility using the Atmcor4OLI program, adapted through the 6S code. These two methods were compared through graphs and a statistical test from samples of four targets using apparent and surface reflectance. The results show that the atmospheric correction is paramount to analyze the spectral response of targets as the atmosphere interferes with the spectral characteristics of the targets from the visible to the mid infrared. In the visible the additive effects predominate while in the near and mid infrared the subtractive effects dominate. The visibility of the airport and from field observation yielded surface reflectance values which were different by the test of means at 1% and not significant at the 5%, as the field observations were not much higher than 10 km. It is concluded that an accurate source of horizontal visibility is key for obtaining correct surface reflectance values, mainly when field observation at the time of satellite overpass was not possible.",

            "abstract": "O objetivo do presente estudo \u00e9 fazer a an\u00e1lise espacial da geomorfometria das encostas atingidas por movimentos de massa a \u00ef\u00ac\u0081 m auxiliar na pesquisa sobre papel da geomorfologia na ocorr\u00eancia destes eventos. Foram utilizadas as cicatrizes dos movimentos de massa oriundos de um dos maiores desastres clim\u00e1ticos do Brasil, ocorrido regi\u00e3o serrana do estado do Rio de Janeiro em janeiro de 2011. As cicatrizes foram sobrepostas aos mapas de declividade e curvatura horizontal a \u00ef\u00ac\u0081 m de caracterizar a geomorfometria das encostas atrav\u00e9s da quanti\u00ef\u00ac\u0081ca\u00e7\u00e3o da \u00e1rea de cicatrizes nas classes dos mapas tem\u00e1ticos. Os resultados demonstraram a presen\u00e7a de \u00e1rea maior de cicatrizes nas classes intermedi\u00e1rias de inclina\u00e7\u00e3o (20 a 45\u00ba), e o acr\u00e9scimo da sua densidade com aumento da declividade, tornando-se inferior a 1 acima de 50\u00ba. Quanto \u00e0 curvatura horizontal, os setores da encosta onde h\u00e1 converg\u00eancia de \u00ef\u00ac\u201auxo foram os mais atingidos pelos movimentos de massa, com valores maiores de densidade das cicatrizes nos setores convergentes, seguidos pelos setores de curvatura planar e, por \u00faltimo, pelos setores divergentes. Como conclus\u00e3o do trabalho destaca-se o papel das vari\u00e1veis geomorfom\u00e9tricas na ocorr\u00eancia dos movimentos de massa, pois os trechos das encostas com declive intermedi\u00e1rio e convergentes foram os mais atingidos pelos movimentos de massa nos eventos de 2011.",

Com o passar do tempo e devido ao desgaste em fun\u00e7\u00e3o do uso, tanto a escala do n\u00edvel quanto da mira podem mudar, degradando a qualidade das observa\u00e7\u00f5es.

            "abstract": "A crescente disponibilidade e melhoria na qualidade de imagens da superf\u00edcie terrestre via Sensoriamento Remoto tem implicado na demanda constante pelo desenvolvimento de novos m\u00e9todos para o processamento e extra\u00e7\u00e3o de informa\u00e7\u00f5es sobre tais imagens. Dentre tais m\u00e9todos, destaca-se a segmenta\u00e7\u00e3o de imagens, a qual visa delimitar objetos distribu\u00eddos na imagem. Neste contexto, este trabalho consiste em propor um novo m\u00e9todo de segmenta\u00e7\u00e3o de imagens fundamentado em conceitos de Agrupamento Hier\u00e1rquico Divisivo, K-M\u00e9dias e Fun\u00e7\u00f5es Kernel. Dois experimentos pr\u00e1ticos a \u00ef\u00ac\u0081 m de validar o m\u00e9todo proposto, assim como compar\u00e1-lo ao m\u00e9todo Crescimento de Regi\u00f5es, foram realizados. Tais experimentos consistem na segmenta\u00e7\u00e3o de imagens obtidas pelos sat\u00e9lites IKONOS-II e LANDSAT-5. A compara\u00e7\u00e3o entre resultados \u00e9 baseada em uma medida de avalia\u00e7\u00e3o de segmenta\u00e7\u00e3o proposta na literatura. Os resultados indicam que o m\u00e9todo proposto \u00e9 capaz de proporcionar resultados satisfat\u00f3rios e com maior n\u00edvel de detalhamento com rela\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e0s delimita\u00e7\u00f5es de objetos.",

A partir da d\u00e9cada de oitenta, a Uni\u00e3o Europeia iniciou um projeto para desenvolvimento de um sistema pr\u00f3prio, que resultou no sistema Galileo, que em 2003 teve sua fase de de\u00ef\u00ac\u0081ni\u00e7\u00e3o conclu\u00edda. A ideia de integra\u00e7\u00e3o de ambas as constela\u00e7\u00f5es surge do grande n\u00famero de sat\u00e9lites dispon\u00edveis (no m\u00ednimo 24 sat\u00e9lites GPS e 27 Galileo, quando esta estiver completa), o que proporcionaria melhor precis\u00e3o em \u00e1reas com visibilidade restrita e maior possibilidade de obter boa geometria no rastreio. No presente trabalho busca-se analisar as melhorias apresentadas no processamento de dados GPS e GPS em conjunto com Galileo no Posicionamento por Ponto com uso de pseudodist\u00e2ncia, efem\u00e9rides precisas e corre\u00e7\u00f5es do atraso troposf\u00e9rico e ionosf\u00e9rico. Primeiramente \u00e9 apresentada uma breve revis\u00e3o das caracter\u00edsticas do sistema GPS, bem como um hist\u00f3rico, caracter\u00edsticas e estado da arte do sistema Galileo, e em seguida s\u00e3o realizados testes de posicionamento para per\u00edodos de mar\u00e7o e julho de 2014. Para os testes foram utilizados dados de uma esta\u00e7\u00e3o da Rede GNSS-SP; estes dados s\u00e3o disponibilizados em arquivos de observa\u00e7\u00e3o no novo formato RINEX 3. Considerando-se todos os casos analisados nesse artigo, o uso integrado GPS e Galileo apresentou melhoria em rela\u00e7\u00e3o ao uso independente do sistema GPS em 83,3% dos casos, melhoria essa que chega a 22,2%.",

            "abstract": "A geoecologia estuda a intera\u00e7\u00e3o entre os seres vivos e o meio onde eles vivem. Muitas vezes esses estudos levam em considera\u00e7\u00e3o em suas an\u00e1lises a \u00e1rea de superf\u00edcie projetada, implicando em an\u00e1lises imprecisas por n\u00e3o levar em conta as nuances do relevo no c\u00e1lculo de \u00e1rea. Nesse sentido, o objetivo da pesquisa \u00e9 analisar o impacto do uso de mensura\u00e7\u00f5es em \u00e1rea de superf\u00edcie planim\u00e9trica e real nas an\u00e1lises geoecol\u00f3gicas, e assim saber o impacto do uso da \u00e1rea de superf\u00edcie planim\u00e9trica no c\u00e1lculo do \u00edndice de Reserva Legal. Na elabora\u00e7\u00e3o da pesquisa, primeiramente para possibilitar a observa\u00e7\u00e3o da diferen\u00e7a entre as duas \u00e1reas, foram constru\u00eddos s\u00f3lidos geom\u00e9tricos, sendo eles: cone, pir\u00e2mide, semi-esfera e tetraedro. Posteriormente \u00e0 constru\u00e7\u00e3o dos s\u00f3lidos foi feito o c\u00e1lculo da \u00e1rea de superf\u00edcie planim\u00e9trica e \u00e1rea de superf\u00edcie real desses mesmos s\u00f3lidos e calculada a diferen\u00e7a de entre as duas \u00e1reas, e assim estabelecer uma rela\u00e7\u00e3o de representa\u00e7\u00e3o. A sele\u00e7\u00e3o por tais s\u00f3lidos se deve \u00e0 associa\u00e7\u00e3o de fei\u00e7\u00f5es encontradas no relevo, ou seja, que podem ser vistas na paisagem. Na \u00e1rea de estudo selecionada, maci\u00e7o da Tijuca, al\u00e9m das observa\u00e7\u00f5es do comportamento do par\u00e2metro \u00e1rea, foi analisada a implica\u00e7\u00e3o desse par\u00e2metro no c\u00e1lculo do \u00edndice de Reserva Legal. Resultados mostram que h\u00e1 uma rela\u00e7\u00e3o inversamente proporcional entre o par\u00e2metro \u00e1rea e o indicador, ou seja, quanto maior o valor de \u00e1rea, menor o valor do indicador. Com isso, pode-se concluir que a considera\u00e7\u00e3o da \u00e1rea planim\u00e9trica nos estudos geoecol\u00f3gicos pode de fato implicar em an\u00e1lises imprecisas, pois esses indicadores podem gerar informa\u00e7\u00f5es distorcidas no subs\u00eddio ao planejamento ambiental.",

Essas altera\u00e7\u00f5es observadas ao longo do tempo definem o que chamamos de Trajet\u00f3rias de Mudan\u00e7a de Cobertura da Terra. Tais trajet\u00f3rias, uma vez caracterizadas, podem fornecer informa\u00e7\u00f5es valiosas acerca de diferentes processos ambientais, como por exemplo, o processo de degrada\u00e7\u00e3o florestal. No entanto, existem poucas ferramentas dispon\u00edveis para a caracteriza\u00e7\u00e3o de trajet\u00f3rias de mudan\u00e7a de cobertura da Terra, pois a maior parte da literatura sobre trajet\u00f3rias considera o conceito no contexto de estudo dos objetos m\u00f3veis, com uma outra sem\u00e2ntica associada. Com o objetivo de extrair e caracterizar trajet\u00f3rias no contexto da mudan\u00e7a de cobertura da Terra, este trabalho aproveita os conceitos j\u00e1 existentes sobre trajet\u00f3rias e apresenta uma redefini\u00e7\u00e3o para alguns dos padr\u00f5es de comportamento usualmente utilizados no contexto das trajet\u00f3rias de objetos m\u00f3veis. Para demonstrar suas possibilidades de utiliza\u00e7\u00e3o, foram conduzidos dois experimentos em uma base de dados de degrada\u00e7\u00e3o florestal da regi\u00e3o amaz\u00f4nica, onde os resultados permitiram identificar e caracterizar algumas das trajet\u00f3rias presentes.",

Tal \u00e9 o caso dos Sistemas Verticais de Refer\u00eancia (SVR) e suas materializa\u00e7\u00f5es regionais e globais. Os SVRs assumiram papel preponderante, cumprindo com suas fun\u00e7\u00f5es usuais em car\u00e1ter regional e nacional, e sendo o fundamento para o monitoramento de processos f\u00edsicos associados a mudan\u00e7as no Sistema Terra.

O SIRGAS-GTIII tem estabelecido diretrizes, metodologias e termos de refer\u00eancia para o cumprimento destas tarefas que s\u00e3o discutidos neste trabalho. De forma central s\u00e3o propostas a\u00e7\u00f5es fundamentais para a moderniza\u00e7\u00e3o das RVRN no contexto do SIRGAS-GTIII.

Assuming that different types of users deserve different types of maps, previous theoretical methodological and empirical studies might bring to light the real importance and effectiveness of associative maps, pictorial for the area. Considering the previous discussion, current inquiries aim at working on the creation of a cartographic project of Tourist Web-Map believing that this cartographic product can offer both a set of maps at multiple scales and in different reality abstraction levels, which do not necessarily depend on a preexisting web geoservices platform. This brings to the tourist\/user three main possibilities: facilitate his\/her understanding (reading of the map), thanks to the use of information redundancy resource, where the same representation is  offered in different cognitives degrees (more or less associative or pictorial); offer a number of information of the appropriate destination to the process of cartographic generalization by allowing the space representation at  multiple scales; may also make the product more democratically available (network access to a greater number of people), beyond the user have the possibility to    customize the printing of maps according to his\/her interest.",

The IFRD2 gene is expressed in many tissues including skeletal muscle, kidney, heart, brain, lung, placenta and liver in adult humans and is highly expressed in adult human skeletal muscle and heart. In mice, interferon-related developmental regulator 2 (IFRD2) may be associated with early haematopoiesis after gastrulation and in the hepatic primordium Buanne et\u00a0al., 1998. In this study, we analysed the molecular characteristics of the IFRD2 gene identified from Pagrus major (PmIFRD2) and performed multiple alignments and phylogenetic analyses of the protein sequence. In addition, we examined the expression pattern of IFRD2 in healthy red sea bream tissues and the temporal expression pattern after challenging with various pathogens [Edwardsiella piscicida (E. piscicida), Streptococcus iniae (S. iniae) and red sea bream iridovirus (RSIV)]. This study characterises the non-specific immune response of the red sea bream after viral and microbial infections. Keywords: Interferon-related developmental regulator 2 (IFRD2), Red sea bream, Edwardsiella piscicida, Streptococcus iniae, Red sea bream iridovirus (RSIV)",

Measurements were done on five corneal regions: central, nasal, inferior, temporal and superior. The findings were compared between men and women using the non-parametric Mann-Whitney U test.\nResults: Mean age of male subjects was 28.0 years and that of female participants was 26.8 years (P = 0.063). There was a significant difference in corneal sensitivity between men and women in the superior (P = 0.013), temporal (P = 0.020) and inferior (P = 0.046) regions. There was no significant difference in corneal sensitivity in the central (P = 0.862) and nasal (P = 0.273) regions.\nConclusion: Except for the central and nasal regions, corneal sensitivity is significantly higher in men as compared to women. The reason for this difference is not yet evident.",

METHODS: Phenotypical data on 104 unrelated Iranian PCG patients who had previously been screened for CYP1B1 mutations were analyzed. Emphasis was placed on analysis of sex ratios among patients with and without CYP1B1 mutations. In addition to sex, familial and sporadic incidence and clinical features including age at onset, bilateral\/unilateral involvement, corneal diameter, intraocular pressure, and cup-disc ratios were compared between these two groups. Information on phenotypical parameters was available for most but not all patients. RESULTS: Among the 93 PCG patients whose sex was recorded, 57 were male (61.3%) and 36 were female (38.7%) (P=0.03). Patients with CYP1B1 mutations included 37 male (66.1%) and 29 female (43.9%) subjects (P=0.30), while patients without the mutation included 20 (74.1%) male and 7 (25.9%) female individuals (P=0.013). Our data did not provide conclusive evidence on difference in severity of the disease between those with and without CYP1B1 mutations, nor between the two sexes. CONCLUSION: Consistent with data on PCG patients from other populations, the overall incidence of PCG in Iran seems to be higher among male subjects. The difference in incidence between the two sexes was not significant among patients whose disease was due to mutations in CYP1B1. The overall higher incidence of PCG among male subjects seems to be attributable to a higher incidence in male patients not harboring CYP1B1 mutations, suggesting that other genes or factors may be involved in manifestation of PCG phenotypes in a sex dependent manner.&lt;\/p&gt; ",

            "abstract": "Purpose: To measure oxygen tension in the aqueous humor of human eyes under different oxygenation conditions. \nMethods: This prospective comparative interventional case series consisted of two parts. In the first part, 120 consecutive patients scheduled for cataract surgery were randomized into group I (control group) in which surgery was performed under local anesthesia inhaling 21% oxygen; group II in whom general anesthesia using 50% oxygen was employed; and group III receiving general anesthesia with 100% oxygen. After aspirating 0.2 ml aqueous humor under sterile conditions, the aqueous sample and a simultaneously drawn arterial blood sample were immediately analyzed using a blood gas analyzer. In part II the same procedures were performed in 10 patients after fitting a contact lens and patching the eye for 20 minutes (group IV) and in 10 patients after transcorneal delivery of oxygen at a flow rate of 5 L\/min (group V). \nResults: Mean aqueous PO2 in groups I, II and III was 112.3\u00b16.2, 141.1\u00b120.4, and 170.1\u00b127 mmHg, respectively (P values <0.001) and mean arterial PO2 was 85.7\u00b17.9, 184.6\u00b146, and 379.1\u00b175.9 mmHg, respectively (P values <0.001). Aqueous PO2 was 77.2\u00b19.2 mmHg in group IV and 152.3\u00b110.9 mmHg in group V (P values <0.001). There was a significant correlation between aqueous and blood PO2 (r=0.537, P<0.001). The contribution of atmospheric oxygen to aqueous PO2 was 23.7%. \nConclusion: Aqueous oxygen tension is mostly dependent on the systemic circulation and in part on the atmosphere. Increasing inspiratory oxygen and transcorneal oxygen delivery both increase aqueous PO2 levels.",

            "abstract": "Optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) is a new, non-invasive imaging system that generates volumetric data of retinal and choroidal layers. It has the ability to show both structural and blood flow information. Split-spectrum amplitude-decorrelation angiography (SSADA) algorithm (a vital component of OCTA software) helps to decrease the signal to noise ratio of flow detection thus enhancing visualization of retinal vasculature using motion contrast. Published studies describe potential efficacy for OCTA in the evaluation of common ophthalmologic diseases such as diabetic retinopathy, age related macular degeneration (AMD), retinal vascular occlusions and sickle cell disease. OCTA provides a detailed view of the retinal vasculature, which allows accurate delineation of microvascular abnormalities in diabetic eyes and vascular occlusions. It helps quantify vascular compromise depending upon the severity of diabetic retinopathy. OCTA can also elucidate the presence of choroidal neovascularization (CNV) in wet AMD. In this paper, we review the knowledge, available in English language publications regarding OCTA, and compare it with the conventional angiographic standard, fluorescein angiography (FA). Finally, we summarize its potential applications to retinal vascular diseases. Its current limitations include a relatively small field of view, inability to show leakage, and tendency for image artifacts. Further larger studies will define OCTA's utility in clinical settings and establish if the technology may offer a non-invasive option of visualizing the retinal vasculature, enabling us to decrease morbidity through early detection and intervention in retinal diseases.",

Although ultrasonographic characteristics of the choroidal masses were comparable to those of choroidal hemangiomas, fluorescein angiography revealed delayed initial fluorescence along with minimal fluorescence in subsequent phases of the angiogram which were in clear distinction from the earlier appearing and progressively intense fluorescence observed with circumscribed choroidal hemangiomas. \nConclusion: Small cell neuroendocrine tumors and alveolar soft part sarcomas should be considered among the differential diagnoses for orange-colored choroidal metastases. Identifying these choroidal lesions could facilitate localizing the occult primary tumor. Fluorescein angiography may differentiate a unifocal orange choroidal metastasis from a circumscribed choroidal hemangioma.",

            "abstract": "Background: Achieving balanced gaps is a key surgical goal in total knee arthroplasty, yet most methods rely on subjective surgeon feel and experience to assess and achieve knee balance intraoperatively. Our objective was to evaluate the ability to quantitatively plan and achieve a balanced knee throughout the range of motion using robotic-assisted instrumentation in a tibia-first, gap-balancing technique. Methods: A robotic-assisted, gap-balancing technique was used in 121 consecutive knees. After resection of the proximal tibia, a computer-controlled tensioning device was inserted into the knee joint and the pre-femoral-resection knee gaps were acquired dynamically throughout flexion under controlled load. Predicted gap profiles were used to plan the femoral implant by adjusting the implant alignment and position within certain boundaries to achieve a balanced knee throughout the range of flexion. Femoral cuts were then made according to this plan using a miniature robotic-assisted cutting guide. The tensioning device used to measure the pre-femoral-resection gaps was then reinserted into the joint to quantify the final gap balance under known tension. The final gap profiles were then compared with the predictive gap plans. Results: The overall root mean square error between the predicted and achieved gaps was 1.3 mm and 1.5 mm for the medial and lateral sides, respectively. Use of robotic assistance resulted in over 90% of knees having mediolateral balance within 2 mm across the flexion range. Gaps at 0\u00b0 flexion were 2 mm smaller than the gaps at 90\u00b0. This difference decreased to less than 1 mm when comparing the tibiofemoral gaps at 10\u00b0, 45\u00b0, and 90\u00b0. Conclusions: Imageless, robotic-assisted total knee arthroplasty accurately predicts postoperative gaps before femoral resections. This allows surgeons to virtually plan femoral implant alignment and optimize gap balance throughout the range of motion. The accurate prediction of gaps throughout the arc of motion combined with precise, robotically assisted femoral resection produces accurate postoperative ligament balance consistently.

The purpose of this review is to identify and assess available published evidence of cardiomyopathy in hip arthroplasty patients and to derive recommendations for management. Methods: We evaluated 23 cases reported until October 2018 and stratified them into 3 categories, based upon pre-existing risk factors for cardiomyopathy, histological confirmation, and evidence of systemic signs of cobalt toxicity. Results: Cobalt toxicity was considered to be the definite cause of cardiomyopathy in 8 cases, and probably contributory in 13 cases. Two cases were considered to have developed cardiomyopathy secondary to pre-existing risk factors. Majority of the patients had a good recovery of cardiac function after hip revision and cardiac management, but 5 cases deteriorated and died. Conclusions: Although cobalt-related cardiomyopathy has been reported in a small number of cases of hip arthroplasty, a delay or missed diagnosis may lead to significant morbidity and mortality. Timely diagnosis, removal of causative implant, and avoidance of metal articulations in revision for fractured ceramic implants may help in an effective management.

            "abstract": "Background and Aim: Dendrophthoe pentandra L. Miq (benalu duku) is a parasitic herb that commonly grows on the host plant Lansium domesticum. Researchers have found that the plant contains anticancer compounds and may contain phytoandrogens, including progesterone-like compounds, in its crude methanol extract. The objective of the current study was to investigate the compound of phyto progesterone in benalu duku leaves after extracted by methanol and prepared using an analytical column of high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC).\r\n\r\nMaterials and Methods: About 400 g of benalu duku leaves were pulverized, and their compounds were isolated by the isocratic method using an RP-18 analytical column (5 \u03bcm) with a mobile phase of 70:30 (methanol: water) in a photodiode array detector adjusted to 254 nm. The phyto progesterone compound was identified at a retention time of approximately 6.01 min.\r\n\r\nResults: By LC-electrospray ionization mass spectrometry focusing on molecular fractions, the fingerprint area of the Fourier transform-infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR, cm\u22121) and Hnuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra indicated that the phyto progesterone product isolated was identical to the certified reference material of pure progesterone, particularly the specific functional groups in the FT-IR spectrum at wavenumbers of 1317.43 cm\u22121 and 1386.86 cm\u22121 and in the proton HNMR spectrum at carbon 21 of progesterone (p<0.05).\r\n\r\nConclusion: Each 49.888 \u03bcg\/mL of crude benalu duku leaf extract dissolved in the mobile phase contained 28.515\u00b10.713 \u03bcg\/mL phyto progesterone.",

It is recommended that all neonates be screened by red reflex examination at birth and suspected cases be referred to ophthalmic centers. Early surgery (<6 weeks of age, based on general neonatal health) is important for achieving the best visual outcome particularly in unilateral cases. In bilateral cases, surgery is highly recommended before appearance of strabismus or nystagmus (<10 weeks of age) with no longer than a one-week interval between the fellow eyes. Parents should be informed that surgery is a starting point and not the endpoint of treatment. Appropriate postoperative management including immediate optical correction in the form of aphakic glasses or contact lenses, or intraocular lens (IOL) implantation at the appropriate age (>1 year) is highly recommended. After surgery, amblyopia treatment and periodic follow-up examinations should be started as soon as possible to achieve a satisfactory visual outcome. Practitioners should consider the possibility of posterior capsular opacity, elevated intraocular pressure and amblyopia during follow-up, especially in eyes with microphthalmia and\/or associated congenital anomalies. All strabismic children should undergo slit lamp examination prior to strabismus surgery to rule out congenital lens opacities. From a social point of view, equal and fair medical care should be provided to all children regardless of gender.",

            "abstract": "The incursion of Information Technologies in the field of education is an undeniable fact that today includes immersion in media education in the classroom. The increase in the use of ICTs in the classroom has raised a concern about the possible impact on the prevalence of problems associated with problematic use of the Internet. This article presents data on an exploratory cross-sectional non-experimental design carried out based on a non-probability prepositive sample through the application of an ad-hoc developed questionnaire. The data in this article correspond to the responses of 832 students of Compulsory Secondary Education in three educational centres in the Autonomous Community of Cantabria, Spain. Two of the educational centres are privately owned, and one of them is public. One of the private centres uses educational methodologies based on the high use of information and communication technologies, as each student uses a personal computer in the classroom. The questionnaire used includes EUPI-A, SOGS-RA, and CERM scales. The questionnaire also includes questions about time spent on internet use and sports betting and gambling or game participation. The data are of interest of researchers in developmental, educational, and behavioural psychology and in statistical scale development.

The plant was collected in Johannesburg (South Africa) and the extract was prepared by firstly air-drying fresh D. stramonium leaves for one week, grinding the dry leaves into fine powder, followed by solvent extraction using a 1:1 solvent mixture of dichloromethane and methanol (v\/v) to extract the compounds. The extract was concentrated at 65\u00a0\u00b0C to obtain a solid crude extract which was then stored under refrigeration at \u221280\u00a0\u00b0C. Qualitative tandem liquid chromatography quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometry (LC-QTOF-MS\/MS) was utilized to identify compounds in the extract. The data processing revealed the presence of 76 known compounds in the crude extract from the leaves. This data article contains the m\/z [M\u00a0+\u00a0H+] values, retention times and corresponding database search hit identities of the 76 compounds and the comprehensive list of m\/z values detected during the LC-QTOF-MS\/MS analysis.

Here, we report the complete genome sequence of L. lactis ACA-DC 178 isolated from Greek Kasseri cheese. The chromosome of ACA-DC 178 contains 2,050,316 bp with a GC content of 49.6%. A total of 2,112 genes were identified in the genome sequence including 1,752 protein-coding genes, 239 putative pseudogenes, 94 tRNA and 27 rRNA genes. According to the COG annotation, about 80% of the protein-coding genes (1,417 proteins) were assigned to at least one functional category. Approximately the 1\/3 of these proteins were distributed among three categories, namely replication, recombination and repair (category L: 10.6%), translation, ribosomal structure and biogenesis (category J: 7.5%) and amino acid transport and metabolism (category E: 7.2%). Fourteen integrated GIs with a total of 159 genes were found in ACA-DC 178 genome. Several of these genes encode proteins associated with exopolysaccharide biosynthesis, amino acid transport and subunits of restriction-modification systems. One large CRISPR array of 3,197 bp containing 52 spacers, several of which are identical to phage sequences having hosts in the genus Lactobacillus, was also identified. The annotated genome sequence of L. lactis ACA-DC 178 is deposited at the European Nucleotide Archive under the accession number LS991409. Raw reads are deposited in the Sequence Read Archive (SRR8866601-3). Keywords: Lactic acid bacteria, Dairy, Fermentation, Genomics, CRISPR, Genomic island, Milk",

We present raw synchrotron data from three subsequent experiments at different beamlines, normalized XAS spectra and k2-weighted oscillatory \u03c7(k) functions extracted from one of the datasets. Pd K-edge spectra were collected for the samples in 5% H2\/He, 3% H2\/He and pure He in the temperature range from room temperature (RT) to 450\u00a0\u00b0C. Pt L3-edge were collected for the samples in 3% H2\/He, 10% H2\/He and pure He in the temperature range from RT to 300\u00a0\u00b0C. All spectra are reported together with the used atmosphere and temperature. For the analysis of all reported datasets, please see \u201cEvolution of Pt and Pd species in functionalized UiO-67 metal-organic frameworks\u201d.

We report herein cellular proteome datasets of EA.hy926 human endothelial cells under physiologic condition and after treatment with 100 \u03bcM caffeine or EGCG for 24-h. Cellular proteins were extracted and subjected to in-solution tryptic digestion using filter-aided sample preparation (FASP) method. The digested peptides were analyzed by nanoflow liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (nanoLC-ESI-Qq-TOF MS\/MS). Finally, the mass spectral data were searched against the human Swiss-Prot database using Mascot 2.4 search engine and quantified using Skyline v.3.5 software and BiblioSpec algorithm. All of these data were used for further comparative proteomics study followed by bioinformatics analyses to investigate differential biochemical effects of caffeine and EGCG on human endothelial cells (Chanthick et\u00a0al., 2019) [1].

This article includes the phenotypic data of leaf and root glucosinolate (GSL) profiles across a diversity panel of 288 B. napus genotypes, as well as information on population structure and levels of GSLs grouped by crop types. Moreover, data on genetic associations of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers and gene expression markers (GEMs) for the major GSL types are presented in detail, while Manhattan plots and QQ plots for the associations of individual GSLs are also included. Root genetic association are supported by differential expression analysis generated from root RNA-seq.

In this investigation, 1.5 mL injectable calcium hydroxyapatite (Radiesse) was utilized in an off-label application under local anesthesia. We evaluated the effect of orbital volume augmentation for correction of enophthalmos.\nResults: Five women and seven men with a mean age of 35 years (range, 21-72 years) were included in the study. The mean follow-up was 19.5 months (range, 16-27 months). Enophthalmos and deep superior sulcus were reduced in all patients during all follow-up visits postoperatively. The mean improvement of enophthalmos was 2.58 mm (range, 1-5 mm) and the improvement in deformity grading of superior sulcus was 0.83 (range, 0-4 grade). The mean marginal reflex distance increased by 0.6 mm (range of -1 to 3 mm). Complications included increase in ptosis in two cases and extrusion of the filler accompanied by discoloration of the skin in one case.\nConclusion: The use of injectable calcium hydroxyapatite for orbital volume restoration in anophthalmic sockets is a simple, fast, and minimally invasive method with considerable long-term effects and low complications.",

Observations were made on its physicochemical, lipolysis, and microbiological characteristics. The proteolysis pattern was measured with sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.\r\n\r\nResults: The protein, fat, ash and total solids levels of cold-stored cheese were higher than the frozen-stored one. The frozen-stored cheese's free fatty acids (FFA) and acid degree value (ADV) levels are lower than those of the cold-stored cheese as indicated by the partial lipolysis event. The total yeast in the frozen-stored cheese is lower than that in the frozen-stored cheese. Finally, the electrophoresis profile indicates that proteolysis of the frozen-stored cheese is formed since there have been detected \u03b1s1-casein, \u03b1s2-casein, \u03b2-casein, and \u03ba-casein in the casein breakdown during the 60-day storage.\r\n\r\nConclusion: The physicochemical characteristics of cold-stored cheese are better than the cheese stored at frozen temperature. However, frozen-stored cheese produces lower FFA and ADV than cold-stored cheese and lipolysis occurs only partially.",

            "abstract": "Abstract: The role of Helicobacter pylori on the development of gastro-duodenal diseases and gastric cancer, demands the availability of reliable tests to diagnose that infectious disease. The rapid urease test, widely used, is a valuable tool for this purpose, but its expense limits the applicability of this test in our country. In this research, the diagnostic validity of a non-commercial inexpensive urease test was evaluated. It was prepared with Christensen\u2019s urea agar, applied to antral gastric biopsies from 75 symptomatic adults who were submitted to digestive endoscopy. The positive result to any of the following methods was used as infection criteria: bacteriologic culture, Giemsa histological stain and polymerase chain reaction 35 out of 37 patients, in whom the infection was detected, were correctly diagnosed by this test (94.6%), and 29 of them (82.8%) were detected after two-hour incubation. The rate of false negatives was significantly reduced, and both sensitivity and diagnostic accuracy were increased in the readings practiced after 24-hour incubation. In conclusion, the performance of the urease test evaluated suggests that this is a highly reliable and low-cost tool for the diagnosis of H. pylori infection in individuals submitted to digestive endoscopy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nResumen: La asociaci\u00f3n entre la infecci\u00f3n por Helicobacter pylori y el desarrollo de enfermedades gastroduodenales y c\u00e1ncer g\u00e1strico, exige disponer de pruebas confiables para diagnosticar esta infecci\u00f3n. La prueba r\u00e1pida de ureasa, ampliamente difundida, es una herramienta valiosa para este fin, pero su elevado costo limita su aplicabilidad en nuestro medio. En el presente trabajo se evalu\u00f3 la validez diagn\u00f3stica de una prueba de ureasa no comercial y de bajo costo, preparada con agar urea de Christensen, aplicada a biopsias g\u00e1stricas antrales de 75 adultos sintom\u00e1ticos, sometidos a endoscopia gastrointestinal. Como criterio de infecci\u00f3n, se emple\u00f3 la positividad a cualquiera de las siguientes metodolog\u00edas: cultivo bacteriol\u00f3gico, coloraci\u00f3n histol\u00f3gica de Giemsa y reacci\u00f3n en cadena de la polimerasa. De 37 pacientes en quienes se detect\u00f3 la infecci\u00f3n, 35 fueron correctamente diagnosticados mediante esta prueba (94.6%). 29 de ellos (82.8%) fueron detectados a las dos horas de incubaci\u00f3n. Al realizar la lectura a las 24 horas de incubaci\u00f3n, se redujo significativamente la tasa de falsos negativos, y se incrementaron la sensibilidad y la exactitud diagn\u00f3stica. En conclusi\u00f3n, el comportamiento de la prueba de ureasa ensayada sugiere que \u00e9sta es una herramienta altamente confiable y de bajo costo para el diagn\u00f3stico de la infecci\u00f3n por H. pylori en individuos sometidos a endoscopia gastrointestinal.",

            "abstract": "Abstract: The search for techniques for the diagnostic confirmation of Dengue (IgM and IgG) and recent commercialization of such serums requires of the study of their sensibility, specificity, reproductibility, speed and costs. For the purpose of comparing two serological techniques for the diagnosis of this infection, 184 serum samples of patients with confirmed diagnosis of Dengue and 60 with Rubella, were analyzed by immune-chromatographic (IC) and enzyme linked immune-absorbent tests (ELISA) by determination of anti-dengue antibody IgM and IgG. In the IC and ELISA techniques levels of 0,70 and 0,79 in nosologic sensibility were obtained, respectively in the determination of antibody IgM; while the sensibility of ELISA IgG resulted significantly elevated (p<0,0001) with respect to IC (0,92 vs 0,65). Both techniques reached reproduction levels of 98% and a specificity of 100%. These results suggest that ELISA is best for the detection of primary and secondary infections, while IC was the fastest assay and applicable in outbreaks and epidemics; however, it was less sensitive for the diagnosis of secondary infections for dengue virus and consequently less adequate for the screening of dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome (DHF\/DSS) in endemic areas.\r\n\r\n\r\nResumen: La b\u00fasqueda de t\u00e9cnicas para la confirmaci\u00f3n diagn\u00f3stica de Dengue y su reciente comercializaci\u00f3n requieren su estudio en cuanto a sensibilidad, especificidad, reproducibilidad, rapidez y costo. Con el objetivo de comparar dos t\u00e9cnicas serol\u00f3gicas para el diagn\u00f3stico de esta infecci\u00f3n, se analizaron 184 sueros provenientes de pacientes con diagn\u00f3stico confirmatorio de Dengue y 60 de Rub\u00e9ola para la evaluaci\u00f3n de la especificidad. Fueron procesados por el m\u00e9todo de Inmunocromatograf\u00eda (IC) e Inmunoensayo Enzim\u00e1tico (ELISA) para la determinaci\u00f3n de anticuerpos IgM e IgG antidengue. Para IC y ELISA se obtuvo un 0,70 y 0,79 respectivamente, de sensibilidad nosol\u00f3gica en la determinaci\u00f3n de anticuerpos IgM; en la determinaci\u00f3n de IgG la sensibilidad del ELI- SA result\u00f3 significativamente incrementada (p<0,0001) con respecto a IC (0,92 vs. 0,65).

            "abstract": "Abstract Objective To date, there is little information on how lay people understand and discuss sleep in the context of daily life. Efforts to conceptualize sleep quality have been largely driven by clinical considerations of sleep disorders. As such, they are not necessarily of how normal sleepers without clinical expertise conceptualize sleep quality. A phenomenological approach was taken to understand the essence of the sleep experience and the concepts held by lay people without sleep disorders. A sentence completion questionnaire was developed and administered to a quota sample of 64 respondents who were selected aiming for sufficient representation of different gender, ages, and education levels. Results Significant sentences and meaningful units were derived inductively, resulting in a classification of nine categories. The major facets of sleep experience of lay people were \u2018daytime functioning\u2019, \u2018interruptions during the night\u2019 and \u2018before bed state\u2019. This implies that the experienced sleep quality is not only depending on the progress of the night. These results can guide future research to provide suitable psychometric measures for normal sleepers, as well as the design of sleep data visualization applications in the context of health self-monitoring.",

It is more frequent in immuno-suppressed patients and associated with debilitating diseases. One of the presentation forms is cutaneous. Case report: A premature newborn female, with 34 weeks of gestation, was admitted in the intensive care unit with hyaline membrane disease as the only concern. On the fifth day of hospitalization a purple round pointed lesion in the left cheek appeared that became a profound necrosis. Treatment began with imipenem, vancomycin, and amikacin, together with surgical debridement. Cultures and histo-pathological studies showed non-septate hyphae, and cultures identified Rhizopus sp. As soon as the culture results were available, additional treatment with amphotericin B 1.5 mg per Kg per day was initiated. The evolution of patient was satisfactory and she was released from the intensive care unit. Conclusion: We observed how important the immunological state of the patient is, and treatment must be aggressive, multidisciplinary and always oriented to each individual case.\r\n\r\n\r\nResumen: Introducci\u00f3n: la mucormicosis es una infecci\u00f3n grave causada por hongos oportunistas, del orden de los mucorales, de alta mortalidad.

Al quinto d\u00eda de hospitalizaci\u00f3n se aprecia lesi\u00f3n viol\u00e1cea puntiforme en mejilla izquierda la cual progresa hacia la necrosis abarcando toda la mejilla, se inici\u00f3 tratamiento con imipenem, vancomicina y amikacina y adem\u00e1s desbridamiento quir\u00fargico. El estudio micol\u00f3gico e histopatol\u00f3gico reporta hifas no septadas, al cultivo se identific\u00f3 Rhizopus sp, se adicion\u00f3 al tratamiento anfotericina B a 1.5mg por kg por d\u00eda. El paciente evolucion\u00f3 favorablemente y egres\u00f3 de cuidados intensivos. Conclusi\u00f3n: es de inter\u00e9s la forma de adquisici\u00f3n nosocomial y el estado inmunol\u00f3gico del paciente y que el tratamiento debe de ser agresivo, multidisciplinario y siempre individualizado.\r\n",

            "abstract": "Abstract: A prospective and cross-sectional study was designed to compare various diagnostics methods for bacterial vaginosis (VB). One hundred and one women who attended the Gynecology and Obstetrics Department and the Chinquiquira Hospital were included in the study; to whom Amsel\u00b4s criteria (regarded as a standard diagnostic test) were applied, and samples of vaginal secretion were evaluated by both methods: Papanicolau smear and Gram stain (both of which are microscopic diagnosis methods). VB prevalence was 27.72%. High sensitivity and negative predictive value in all methods were obtained (85.71% and 90.24 to 92%, respectively ). Also specificity (50.68 to 63.01%) and positive predictive values (40 to 47.50%) were low. Eficiency varied little  between methods analyzed (60.39 to 69.30%). Amsel\u00b4s criteria as a diagnostic tool is still recommended in situations where microscopic capabilities are unavailable. Further evaluation as to other factors such as the cost- benefit relation should be measured to establish which one of the actual laboratory methods is the \u201cbest paraclinical standard\u201d for VB.\r\n\r\n\r\nResumen: Para comparar la exactitud diagn\u00f3stica de varios m\u00e9todos paracl\u00ednicos en el diagn\u00f3stico de vaginosis bacteriana (VB), se dise\u00f1\u00f3 un estudio prospectivo y transversal que incluy\u00f3 101 mujeres que acudieron a consulta externa o Emergencia del departamento de Ginecolog\u00eda y Obstetricia del Hospital Chiquinquir\u00e1, a quienes se les aplicaron los criterios de Amsel como \u201cest\u00e1ndar diagn\u00f3stico cl\u00ednico ideal\u201d y se les tom\u00f3 muestra de la secreci\u00f3n vaginal para la evaluaci\u00f3n de dos m\u00e9todos: citolog\u00eda vaginal y tinci\u00f3n de Gram (m\u00e9todos de diagn\u00f3stico microsc\u00f3pico). La frecuencia de VB fue de 28 casos (27,72%). En todas las pruebas se obtuvo buena sensibilidad (85,71%) y alto valor predictivo negativo (90,24 a 92%). Adem\u00e1s se obtuvieron especificidad (50,68 a 63,01%) y valor predictivo positivo (40 a 47,50%) bajos. La eficiencia de los m\u00e9todos estudiados vari\u00f3 escasamente entre 60,39 a 69,30% (p < 0,0001). Aun se recomienda la utilizaci\u00f3n del m\u00e9todo cl\u00ednico (criterios de Amsel) en las consultas en las que no se disponga de m\u00e9todos microsc\u00f3picos, debido a su mayor eficacia diagn\u00f3stica, adem\u00e1s de la realizaci\u00f3n de nuevas investigaciones que determinen otros factores como la relaci\u00f3n costo-beneficio, para determinar el est\u00e1ndar ideal de diagn\u00f3stico paracl\u00ednico de VB.\r\n",

In 2012, during a WHO International Meeting on NS in Kampala, Uganda, it was recommended that fungal contamination of foods should be investigated as a possible cause of the disease. We therefore aimed to assess whether consumption of fungal mycotoxins contributes to NS development. Results We detected similar high levels of total aflatoxin and ochratoxin in mostly millet, sorghum, maize and groundnuts in both households with and without children with NS. Furthermore, there was no significant association between concentrations of total aflatoxin, ochratoxin and doxynivalenol and the presence of children with NS in households. In conclusion, our results show no supporting evidence for the association of NS with consumption of mycotoxins in contaminated foods.",

So, this study was designed to confirm the pivotal role of the nano zinc oxide cream in the alleviation of lead oxide (PbO) induced-allergic dermatitis in rats.Materials and methods: Two concentrations (1% and 6%) of ZnONPs creams were prepared and characterized prior to being used in the study. A total number of 30 male Wistar rats were randomly divided into six groups. Group 1 (negative control), groups 2&amp;3 (either 1% or 6% ZnONPs control groups), group 4 (PbO), groups 5&amp;6 (co-treatment of each ZnONPs concentration+PbO). All rats in different groups were observed daily to determine the severity of dermal gross lesions. Histopathological studies, mRNA analysis, and oxidative stress evaluations were performed on the affected skin tissue. Immunohistochemical studies were performed to evaluate the expression of cluster of differentiation CD4, CD8 and intercellular adhesion molecules ICAM-1 in different groups.Results: PbO caused extensive skin oxidative damage manifested by a significant increase in MDA level with a decrease in GSH content and CAT activity. The results of histopathological and immunohistochemical examinations revealed that topical application of PbO for 14 days led to severe allergic dermatitis with remarkable elevations in the number of CD4+ T-helper, CD8+ T-cytotoxic lymphocytes, and ICAM-1 expression. On the other hand, noticeable improvements were recorded in all the previous toxicopathological parameters among the groups treated by either 1% or 6% ZnO-NPs cream. However, the best results were observed in the group treated with 1% ZnO-NPs cream.Conclusion: Our findings suggest that 1% of ZnO-NPs cream is safe when applied topically on the inflamed skin. Moreover, it had anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects so that, it is recommended to use the 1% ZnO-NPs cream to avert the dermal toxicity-induced by PbO.Keywords: skin, nanoparticles, histopathology, immunohistochemistry, oxidative stress, collagen gene",

            "abstract": "Abstract: Viral hepatitis is a public health problem worldwide, caused by different etiologic agents, such as hepatitis A, B, C, D, E, F or G. However, cases have been reported related to liver disease caused by hepatotropic viruses, such as cytomegalovirus (CMV) and Epstein Barr Virus (EBV). The aim of this study was to establish the differential diagnosis of hepatotropic and non-hepatotropic viruses in patients with symptoms and signs suggestive of liver infection in the city of Maracaibo, Venezuela, 2007. 268 blood samples were collected from patients at different health centers in the city of Maracaibo, who recurred to the Regional Viral Reference Laboratory. The presence of IgM antibodies to hepatitis A virus (HAV), B (HBV), C (HCV), CMV and EBV was detected by ELISA. The results indicate a high incidence of HAV 118\/268 (44.03%), followed by HBV 5\/268 (1.86%) and the absence of HCV. For non-hepatotropic viruses, 4.48% (12\/268) were positive for EBV and 9.7% (26\/268) for CMV. For the above-mentioned viruses, 39.92% (107\/268) are considered negative. This study suggests that CMV and EBV viruses are often involved with liver damage and should be considered as possible etiologic agents for any case of hepatitis. Key words: Cytomegalovirus, Epstein Barr Virus, hepatitis.\r\n\r\nResumen: La hepatitis viral representa un problema de salud p\u00fablica a escala mundial, causada por diferentes  agentes etiol\u00f3gico como el virus de la hepatitis A, B, C, D, E, F o G. Sin embargo, se han reportado casos relacionados con la enfermedad hep\u00e1tica causados por virus no hepat\u00f3tropos como el Citomegalovirus (CMV) y el Virus Epstein Barr (VEB). El objetivo del presente estudio fue establecer el diagn\u00f3stico diferencial de virus hepat\u00f3tropos y no hepat\u00f3tropos en pacientes con s\u00edntomas y signos sugestivo de infecci\u00f3n hep\u00e1tica, de la ciudad de Maracaibo-Venezuela. A\u00f1o 2007. Se recolectaron 268 muestras de sangre de pacientes procedente de diferentes centros de salud de la ciudad de Maracaibo, que acudieron al Laboratorio regional de Referencias Virol\u00f3gica. La presencia de anticuerpos de tipo IgM, para el virus de hepatitis A (VHA), B (VHB), C (VHC), CMV y VEB fue detectada mediante la prueba de ELISA. Los resultados obtenidos indican una alta incidencia del VHA 118\/268(44,03%), seguido del VHB 5\/268(1,86%) y ausencia del VHC. Para virus no hepat\u00f3tropos, el 4,48% (12\/268) fueron positivos para el VEB y el 9,7% (26\/268) para CMV. El 39,92% (107\/268) son considerados negativos para los virus antes mencionados. En este estudio se se\u00f1ala que los virus CMV y VEB suelen estar comprometidos con da\u00f1o hep\u00e1tico y deben ser consideradas como posibles agentes etiol\u00f3gicos ante cualquier caso de hepatitis.",

            "abstract": "Abstract: To determine the prevalence of Blastocystis sp. and its association with epidemiological characteristics, a cross-sectional study was conducted in two communities of the Maracaibo Municipality, State of Zulia. To collect data, an epidemiological record was used; 406 randomly selected individuals participated; for each one, a direct parasitological examination with SSF-Lugol was performed. Individuals over 18 years (72.1%) and females (51.4%) predominated. The overall prevalence of Blastocystis sp. infection was 38.9%; poly-parasitism predominated (54.4 %), identifying Endolimax nana (36.1%) as the most frequently associated commensal species, followed by Giardia intestinalis (22.1%), among the pathogens. There was significant association (p<0.05) between the prevalence of infection with active occupation status, overcrowding, untreated water consumption and lack of adequate conditions to dispose of and eliminate waste. These variables showed OR 95% CI values, which demonstrates their influence as risk factors, reporting the greatest risk of infection (OR=3.18) for the active occupation status. No significant association was noted between the presence of Blastocystis sp. and other epidemiological characteristics (p >0.05). Limitations in community and personal hygiene standards are determinants for the prevalence of Blastocystis sp. in these communities.\r\n\r\nResumen: Para determinar la prevalencia de Blastocystis sp. y su asociaci\u00f3n con caracter\u00edsticas epidemiol\u00f3gicas se realiz\u00f3 una investigaci\u00f3n descriptiva en dos comunidades del Municipio Maracaibo del Estado Zulia. Para la recolecci\u00f3n de datos se emple\u00f3 una ficha epidemiol\u00f3gica; participaron 406 individuos seleccionados aleatoriamente realiz\u00e1ndoseles a cada uno, un examen coproparasitol\u00f3gico directo con SSF-Lugol. Entre los estudiados predominaron los mayores de 18 a\u00f1os (72,1%) y el g\u00e9nero femenino (51,4%). La prevalencia de Blastocystis sp. fue 38,9%, con mayor frecuencia de poliparasitismo (54,4%), identific\u00e1ndose Endolimax nana (36,1%) como especie comensal principalmente asociada, seguida de Giardia intestinalis (22,1%) entre los pat\u00f3genos. Hubo asociaci\u00f3n significativa (p<0.05) entre la prevalencia de la infecci\u00f3n con el status de ocupaci\u00f3n activa, hacinamiento, consumo de agua no tratada y ausencia de adecuadas condiciones para disponer y eliminar basura. Dichas variables mostraron valores OR 95% IC que evidencian su influencia como factores de riesgo, present\u00e1ndose para el status de ocupaci\u00f3n activa el mayor riesgo de infecci\u00f3n (OR = 3,18). No se observ\u00f3 asociaci\u00f3n significativa entre presencia de Blastocystis sp. con otras caracter\u00edsticas epidemiol\u00f3gicas (p>0.05). Las limitaciones en los est\u00e1ndares de higiene comunal y personal son determinantes de la prevalencia de Blastocystis sp. en estas comunidades.",

            "abstract": "Abstract: S. aureus has become a public health problem, due to the difficulty of treating infections caused by methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). The purpose of this research was to determine the production of enterotoxins A, B, C and D and the production of biofilm in clinical isolates of MRSA. Fifty MRSA strains isolated from different types of clinical samples were studied. Detection of enterotoxins was carried out using the technique of reversed phase agglutination, while biofilm production was studied through two tests: Congo red agar and the microplate cell culture method. Enterotoxin production was observed in 9 strains (18%); enterotoxin D (64%) was the most prevalent, followed by B (27%) and A (9%). A significant association was shown between enterotoxin production capacity and the type of sample that came from the strain. Biofilm production was found in 30% and 98% of the strains using the Congo red Agar and microplate cell culture methods, respectively. A correlation of both trials was observed in only 15 strains (30%). It was shown that the microplate cell culture method is more effective for detecting biofilm production in S. aureus strains.\r\n\r\nResumen: S. aureus se ha convertido en un problema de salud p\u00fablica, debido a la dificultad que representa el tratamiento de las infecciones causadas por SARM.

Materials and Methods: Eighty-four fecal samples from moderately malnourished children of both sexes between 8 months and 12 years of age, hospitalized in the Nutrition Rehabilitation Unit of the Chiquinquir\u00e1 Hospital and South General Hospital, Dr. Pedro Iturbe, were analyzed. Each fecal specimen underwent a fresh test with saline solution 0.85%, Lugol staining and Ritchie concentrate. Results: An overall prevalence of parasitized children (58%) was observed; 34.52% were female, 23.81% were male. There was a predominance of monoparasitism 57.14%. Regarding the age group, the 3 to 6 stratums was most heavily parasitized (30. 95%). The c2 revealed a significant relationship between parasitism and age. Species found in the group under study were: Blastocystis spp. (49. 39%), Giardia intestinalis (21.52%), Entamoeba histolytica \/ dispar \/ moshkovskii (11.39%), Entamoeba coli (6.33%) and Trichuris trichiura (6.33%). Conclusions: The results are similar to those obtained in previous research. The high prevalence of protozoa suggests a pattern of direct transmission among the studied population or through consumption of water and \/or food.

Hubo predomino del monoparasitismo en un 57,14%. En cuanto al grupo de edades, el estrato de 3 a 6 a\u00f1os result\u00f3 el mayormente parasitado (30,95% %). El 2 revel\u00f3 que si existe relaci\u00f3n significativa entre las variables Parasitismo y edad. Las especies de enteropar\u00e1sitos encontradas fueron: Blastocystis sp (49,39%), Giardia intestinalis (21,52%) quienes ocuparon los primeros lugares, seguidos de Complejo Entamoeba histolytica\/Entamoeba dispar\/ moshkovskii (11,39%), Entamoeba coli (6,33%) y Trichuris trichiura (6,33%), en todo el grupo estudiado. Conclusiones: Los resultados son similares a los obtenidos en investigaciones previas. La alta prevalencia de protozoarios sugiere un patr\u00f3n de transmisi\u00f3n directa entre la poblaci\u00f3n estudiada o a trav\u00e9s del consumo de agua y\/o alimentos contaminados fecalmente. Se plantea la necesidad de evaluar el comportamiento en la higiene alimentaria y abastecimiento de agua en la poblaci\u00f3n estudiada.",

            "abstract": "Abstract: Pseudomonas aeruginosa is considered one of the most important nosocomial pathogens. Its isolation is commonin intensive care unit patients who also usually have multi-resistance. This greatly limits therapeutic options, since no effective drugs are available for treatment. The study aims to evaluate four phenotypic methods for detecting metallo-beta-lactamases. The double disc synergy with EDTA method, combined imipenem and meropenem disk with EDTA method, the E-Test-MBL method and the modified Hodge method, along with a reference method (PCR), are used to determine the phenotypic method or a combination of these is used that is more valid and safe for implementation in routine bacteriology laboratories. The sensitivity and specificity of the phenotypic methods used was good (over 90%); the modified Hodge test obtained the best results in detecting MBL-producing P. aeruginosa isolates (lower rate of false positive and negative). On analyzing the different combined methods for determining the association with greater sensitivity and specificity, the double disc method associated with the modified Hodge test met these characteristics. Results suggest that these two methods should be routinely used in a bacteriology laboratory, since they are easy to perform, sensitive, specific and economical.\r\n\r\nResumen: Pseudomonas aeruginosa es considerado uno de los pat\u00f3genos nosocomiales m\u00e1s importantes, siendo com\u00fan su aislamiento en pacientes de unidades de cuidados intensivos, en quienes adem\u00e1s suele presentar multirresistencia, esto limita enormemente las opciones terap\u00e9uticas para el tratamiento del paciente, lo que constituye un problema ya que no se disponen de drogas efectivas para el tratamiento.

La sensibilidad y especificidad de los m\u00e9todos fenot\u00edpicos empleados fue buena (m\u00e1s de 90%), de los m\u00e9todos empleados, el test de Hodge modificado fue el que proporcion\u00f3 mejores resultados en la detecci\u00f3n de aislados de P. aeruginosa productores de MBL (menor tasa de falsos positivos y negativos), al analizar los diferentes m\u00e9todos combinados para determinar cu\u00e1l es la asociaci\u00f3n con mayor sensibilidad y especificidad, el m\u00e9todo del doble disco asociado con el test de Hodge modificado reunieron estas caracter\u00edsticas, estos resultados sugieren que estos dos m\u00e9todos se deben emplear de rutina en un laboratorio de Bacteriolog\u00eda, por ser f\u00e1ciles de realizar, econ\u00f3micos, sensibles y espec\u00edficos.",

            "abstract": "Abstract: Coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) have been identified as the etiological agent in various infections and are currently the microorganisms most frequently isolated in blood cultures. However, little is known about the virulence factors produced by CNS that contribute to the pathogenesis of infections caused by these microorganisms. This study was designed to determine the production of staphylococcal enterotoxins, biofilm production and resistance to antimicrobial agents. For this purpose, a total of 48CNS strains isolated from blood cultures at the University Hospital in Maracaibo, Zulia, Venezuela, were studied. Staphylococcal enterotoxins were detected by reversed passive latex agglutination. Biofilm production was assessed in a quantitative assay using a microtiterplate. Susceptibility against antimicrobial agents was tested by the disk diffusion method. Six strains of staphylococci isolates (12.5%) were found to be enterotoxigenic. Of these, 3 strains were positive for staphylococcal enterotoxin D (SED), 2 for SEA and 1 of the isolates was positive for SEB, SEC and SED. Twenty-one isolates (44%) were found to be biofilm producers. A high frequency of resistance was observed with oxacillin (90%), gentamicin (83%) and erythromycin (67%). None of the isolates showed resistance to vancomycin. Taking into consideration that the etiological importance of CNS has often been neglected, the present investigation confirmed that these microorganisms should not be ignored or classified as mere contaminants.\r\n\r\nResumen: Staphylococcus coagulasa negativa (SCN) es el microorganismo que se a\u00edsla con mayor frecuencia en los hemocultivos. Sin embargo, es poco el conocimiento que se tiene sobre los factores de virulencia producidos por SCN que contribuyen a la patog\u00e9nesis de las infecciones causadas por estos microorganismos. El presente estudio se realiz\u00f3 para determinar la producci\u00f3n de enterotoxinas estafiloc\u00f3cicas, la producci\u00f3n de biofilm y la resistencia a los agentes antimicrobianos. Con este prop\u00f3sito, un total 48 cepas de SCN aisladas de hemocultivo en el Hospital Universitario de Maracaibo, Zulia, Venezuela fueron estudiadas. Las enterotoxinas estafiloc\u00f3cicas fueron detectadas por aglutinaci\u00f3n en l\u00e1tex pasiva reversa. La producci\u00f3n de biofilm fue evaluada por un ensayo cuantitativo usando microplacas. La susceptibilidad contra los agentes antimicrobianos fue probada por el m\u00e9todo de difusi\u00f3n del disco. Seis cepas (12,5%) aisladas de estafilococos fueron enterotoxig\u00e9nicas. De estas, 3 fueron positivas para enterotoxina estafiloc\u00f3cica D (EED), 2 para enterotoxina estafiloc\u00f3cica A (EEA) y 1 de los aislamientos fueron positivos para enterotoxina estafiloc\u00f3cica B (EEB), enterotoxina estafiloc\u00f3cica C (EEC) y EED. Veintiuno de los aislamientos (44%) fueron productores de biofilm. Alta frecuencia de resistencia fue observada contra oxacilina (90%), gentamicina (83%) y eritromicina (67%). Ning\u00fan aislamiento mostr\u00f3 resistencia a vancomicina. Teniendo en cuenta que la importancia etiol\u00f3gica de SCN a menudo ha sido ignorada, la presente investigaci\u00f3n confirm\u00f3 que estos microorganismos no deben ser ignorados o clasificados como contaminantes.",

            "abstract": "Abstract: Antimicrobial resistance was determined for 106 S. aureus strain isolates from patients treated in the Bacteriological Reference Center at the University Hospital Autonomous Service, Maracaibo, during the first trimester of 2009, using phenotypic and genotypic methods. Culture, isolation and identification were performed following conventional methodology. Phenotypically, 103 strains (97.17%) were resistant to penicillin G; 54 (50.94%) to methicillin; 43.39% to erythromycin (46) and 34.91% (37) to gentamicin. In addition, 13 (12.26%) were intermediate to erythromycin. Genotypically, 90 strains (84.91%) carried the blaZ gene through the polymerase chain reaction (PCR); 53 (50%) carried the mecA gene; only 10 (9.43%) harbored the gene aac(6\u2019)\/aph(2\u2019\u2019); the gene ermA was detected in 41 isolates (38.68%) and msrA in 17 (16.04%). The discordant results were: (1) A mecA-negative, but methicillin-resistant strain, which proved blaZ-positive and hyper-productive of B-lactamases; (2) An erythromycin-resistant strain, negative for ermA, B, C and msrA genes, and; (3) Twenty-six gentamicin-resistant strains, negative for aac(6\u2019)\/aph(2\u2019\u2019). The phenotypes and genotypes of antimicrobial resistance are related; however, there is a marked variability in the genetic determinants for resistance, which undoubtedly affects phenotypic ex- pression. For oxacillin and, to a lesser degree erythromycin, there is a good match between the resistance phenotypes and genotypes found, noting the greatest discrepancy in the aminoglycosides and penicillin G.\r\n\r\nResumen: Se determin\u00f3 la resistencia antimicrobiana mediante m\u00e9todos fenot\u00edpicos y genot\u00edpicos a 106 cepas de S. aureus aisladas de pacientes atendidos en el Centro de Referencia Bacteriol\u00f3gica del Servicio Aut\u00f3nomo Hospital Universitario de Maracaibo durante el primer trimestre del 2009. El cultivo, aislamiento e identificaci\u00f3n se realiz\u00f3 siguiendo la metodolog\u00eda convencional. Fenot\u00edpicamente, 103 cepas (97,17%) resultaron resistentes a penicilina G; 54 (50,94%) a meticilina; 43,39% a eritromicina (46) y 34,91% (37) a gentamicina. Adem\u00e1s, 13 (12,26%) se mostraron intermedias a eritromicina. Genot\u00edpicamente, 90 cepas (84,91%) portaban el gen blaZ mediante la reacci\u00f3n en cadena de la polimerasa (PCR); 53 (50%) acarreaban el gen mecA; s\u00f3lo 10 (9,43%) albergaban el gen aac(6\u2019)\/aph(2\u2019\u2019); el gen ermA se detect\u00f3 en 41 aislados (38,68%) y msrA en 17 (16,04%). Los resultados discordantes fueron: (1) Una cepa mecA-negativa; pero resistente a meticilina, la cual result\u00f3 blaZ-positiva e hiperproductora de B-lactamasas; (2) Una cepa resistente a eritromicina y negativa para los genes ermA, B, C y msr y; (3) veintis\u00e9is cepas gentamicina-resistentes; pero negativas para aac(6\u2019)\/aph(2\u2019\u2019). Los fenotipos y genotipos de resistencia antimicrobiana est\u00e1n relacionados; sin embargo, existe una marcada variabilidad en los determinantes gen\u00e9ticos de la resistencia lo que repercute, indudablemente en su expresi\u00f3n fenot\u00edpica. Para oxacilina y en menor proporci\u00f3n para eritromicina, existe una buena concordancia entre los fenotipos y genotipos de resistencia encontrados; observ\u00e1ndose la mayor discrepancia en los aminoglic\u00f3sidos, y penicilina G.",

The first refers to the size of the interaction of \u201cstandard papers\u201d in journals appearing in the Web of Science (WoS)\u2014now Clarivate Analytics\u2014and \u201cnon-standard papers\u201d (manuscripts appearing in arXiv). Specifically, we analyze the citations found in the WoS to articles in arXiv. The second aspect is how publication in arXiv affects the citation count of authors. The question is whether or not prepublishing in arXiv benefits authors from the point of view of increasing their citations, or rather produces a dispersion, which would diminish the relevance of their publications in evaluation processes. Data have been collected from arXiv, the websites of the journals, Google Scholar, and WoS following a specific ad hoc procedure. The number of citations in journal articles published in WoS to preprints in arXiv is not large. We show that citation counts from regular papers and preprints using different sources (arXiv, the journal\u2019s website, WoS) give completely different results. This suggests a rather scattered picture of citations that could distort the citation count of a given article against the author\u2019s interest. However, the number of WoS references to arXiv preprints is small, minimizing this potential negative effect.",

            "abstract": "Culture and identity in a society can be represented in the architecture and the meanings intertwined with it. In this sense, the architecture and design are the interface for transferring meaning and identity to the nation and future generations. Persian gardens have been evolved through the history of Persian Empire in regard to the culture and beliefs of the society. This paper aims to investigate the patterns of design and architecture in Persian gardens and the meanings intertwined with their patterns and significant elements such as water and trees. Persian gardens are not only about geometries and shapes; but also manifest different design elements, each representing a specific symbol and its significance among the society. This paper seeks to explore Persian gardens in terms of their geometric structure, irrigation system, network construction and pavilions alongside design qualities such as hierarchy, symmetry, centrality, rhythm and harmony. In the\nsecond stage, the paper investigates the fundamental symbols and their philosophy in the creation of Persian gardens and in relation to the architecture and design.",

            "abstract": "Sacred sites are of conservation value because of their spiritual meaning, as cultural heritage and as remnants of near-natural biotopes in landscapes strongly transformed by man. The vegetation of sacred sites in Morocco was studied recently. Information about their number, spatial pattern or relief position is fragmentary. However, these parameters are important to evaluate their role as refuge for organisms and their representativeness of potential natural vegetation. Therefore, density and spatial pattern of sacred sites on the Tangier Peninsula in NW Morocco were studied based on records on topographic maps and by ground check. Their relief position was examined calculating a logistic regression model based on site-presences and random pseudo-absences. A ground check showed that around 67% of the existing sacred sites are documented in the topographic maps. They occur in the whole study area but are agglomerated around settlements. Although sacred sites occur with preference at elevated sites they can be found in almost all relief positions, thus offering the potential of supporting different types of climax vegetation (climatic climax and pedoclimax). Because of their abundance (around 29 sacred sites \/ 100 km2) and their distribution pattern they could serve as elements of a biotope network in degraded landscapes.",

            "abstract": "Climate warming during the past century has imposed recession of glaciers and perennial snow\/ice patches along the entire Swedish Scandes. On the newly exposed forefields, subfossil wood remnants are being outwashed from beneath ice and snow bodies. In Scandinavia, this kind of detrital wood is a previously unused source of postglacial vegetation and climate history. The present study reports radiocarbon dates of a set of 78 wood samples, retrieved from three main sites, high above modern treelines and stretching along the Swedish Scandes. In accord with previous studies, pine (Pinus sylvestris) colonized early emerging nunataks already during the Late Glacial. Around 9600-9500 cal. yr BP a first massive wave of tree establishment, birch and pine, took place in \"empty\" glacier cirques. Both species grew 400-600 m above their present-ay treeline position and the summer temperatures may have been 3.5 oC warmer than present. In respons to Neoglacial cooling, treelines of both birch and pine descended until their final disappearance from the record 4400 and 5900 cal. yr BP, respectively. During the entire interval 9600 to 4400 cal. yr BP, birch prospered in a 100-150 broad belt above the uppermost pines. The recent emergence of tree remnants in the current habitats relates to the contemporary episode of climate warming, possibly unprecedented for several past millennia. It is inferred, by an anology with the past, that in a future scenario with summers 3.5 \u00b0warmer than present, the birch treeline may rise by 600 m or so.",

For the analysis, two sub-catchments strongly differing in land use within the Weisseritz catchment (Eastern Erzgebirge, Saxony, Germany) were selected. The first step of the evaluation procedure was a biotope assessment using three assessment criteria (naturalness, substitutability, rareness\/endangerment). However, the biotope assessment did not yield any information about spatial distribution or the structural composition of the landscape. Therefore, landscape metrics were applied to analyse the structural and biotope type diversity at the landscape scale. Different landscape metrics (Shannon\/Weaver diversity index, mean patch size index, Interdispersion\/Juxtaposition index) and a weighting system were used to compare the different land use scenarios and the current state. The analysed catchment areas differ substantially in terms of their current state and potential measures regarding flood prevention and nature conservation depending on the location and distribution of biotope types. It was demonstrated that this method can be used for small catchment areas regardless of their land use for assessing, analysing and comparing different land use scenarios for a specific area.",

            "abstract": "Background: Administration of amplitude modulated 27\u00b712\u202fMHz radiofrequency electromagnetic fields (AM RF EMF) by means of a spoon-shaped applicator placed on the patient's tongue is a newly approved treatment for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The mechanism of action of tumour-specific AM RF EMF is largely unknown. Methods: Whole body and organ-specific human dosimetry analyses were performed. Mice carrying human HCC xenografts were exposed to AM RF EMF using a small animal AM RF EMF exposure system replicating human dosimetry and exposure time. We performed histological analysis of tumours following exposure to AM RF EMF. Using an agnostic genomic approach, we characterized the mechanism of action of AM RF EMF. Findings: Intrabuccal administration results in systemic delivery of athermal AM RF EMF from head to toe at levels lower than those generated by cell phones held close to the body. Tumour shrinkage results from differentiation of HCC cells into quiescent cells with spindle morphology. AM RF EMF targeted antiproliferative effects and cancer stem cell inhibiting effects are mediated by Ca2+ influx through Cav3\u00b72\u202fT-type voltage-gated calcium channels (CACNA1H) resulting in increased intracellular calcium concentration within HCC cells only. Interpretation: Intrabuccally-administered AM RF EMF is a systemic therapy that selectively block the growth of HCC cells. AM RF EMF pronounced inhibitory effects on cancer stem cells may explain the exceptionally long responses observed in several patients with advanced HCC.

            "abstract": "Background: R-spondins (Rspo) and leucine-rich repeat-containing G-protein-coupled receptors (LGR) play important roles in development, stem cells survival, and tumorigenicity by activating Wnt signaling pathway. Whether R-spondins-LGR signaling affects the progression of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) remain unknown. This study aims to uncover the role of R-spodin2\/LGR4 in tongue SCC (TSCC). Methods: The expression of Rspo2 in TSCC specimens and its correlation with TSCC clinical outcome were evaluated. Levels of Rspo2 or LGR4 were altered by pharmacological and genetic approaches, and the effects on TSCC progression were assessed. Findings: Aberrantly high levels of Rspo2 were detected in TSCC specimens. Its levels were closely related with lymph node metastasis, clinical stage and survival rate in patients with tongue SCC. Exogenous Rspo2 or overexpression of Rspo2 promoted growth, migration and invasion, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and stem-like properties in SCC both in vivo and in vitro. Silence of Rspo2 abolished these phenotypes. LGR4 was functionally upregulated by Rspo2 in TSCC. Overexpression of Rspo2 increased, whereas Rspo2 silencing decreased the expression of LGR4, leading to subsequent phosphorylation of LRP6 and nuclear translocation of \u03b2-catenin in TSCC cell lines. This nuclear translocation of \u03b2-catenin was associated with a significant alteration in TCF-1, a downstream nuclear transcription factor of \u03b2-catenin, as well as its target genes: CD44, CyclinD1 and c-Myc. Interpretation: Rspo2-LGR4 system regulates growth, migration and invasion, EMT and stem-like properties of TSCC via Wnt\/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway.

            "abstract": "Background: Corneal neovascularization (angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis) compromises corneal transparency and transplant survival, however, the molecular mechanisms of corneal host epithelial and stromal cells in neovascularization have not yet been fully elucidated. Furthermore, the contribution and mechanism of corneal host endothelial cells involved in neovascularization are largely unexplored. Methods: Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, immunoblotting, and ELISA were used to screen and identify potential neovascularization-related factors in human full-thickness vascularized corneal tissues. Lipopolysaccharide was used to induce inflammation in three kinds of corneal host cells in vitro, including corneal epithelial, stromal, and endothelial cells. Fungus was used to establish an animal model of corneal neovascularization in vivo. Tube formation and spheroid sprouting assays were used to evaluate the contribution of three kinds of corneal host cells to the degree of neovascularization under various stimuli. Matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2, alpha-crystallin A chain (CRYAA), galectin-8, Bcl-2, neuropilin-2, MMP-9 plasmids, and recombinant human fibronectin were used to identify the key proteins of corneal host cells involved in corneal inflammatory neovascularization. Findings: All three kinds of corneal host cells influenced corneal neovascularization to varying degrees. MMP-9 in human corneal epithelial cells, MMP-2, and CRYAA in human corneal stromal cells, and MMP-2 and galectin-8 in human corneal endothelial cells are potential key proteins that participate in corneal inflammatory neovascularization. Interpretation: Our data indicated that both the effects of key proteins and corneal host cells involved should be considered for the treatment of corneal inflammatory neovascularization. Keywords: Corneal cells, Neovascularization, MMP-9, MMP-2, CRYAA, Galectin-8",

En ellas, tras la presentaci\u00f3n de una caracterizaci\u00f3n de la problem\u00e1tica general en este campo, se gener\u00f3 un debate que culmin\u00f3 en la elaboraci\u00f3n de una propuesta conjunta de agenda de investigaci\u00f3n, que prioriz\u00f3 determinadas l\u00edneas. Entre las que los participantes destacaron se incluye (a) la necesidad de articulaci\u00f3n entre la educaci\u00f3n b\u00e1sica y la superior para una generaci\u00f3n de competencias en los postulantes, (b) la necesidad de poner \u00e9nfasis en la carrera docente orientada a la mejora de la calidad de las instituciones educativas, (c) la necesidad de la b\u00fasqueda de mecanismos alternativos de financiamiento que involucren al sector privado, (d) la necesidad de una mayor claridad en la regulaci\u00f3n y normatividad existentes, y (e) la necesidad de un impulso mayor al v\u00ednculo entre la educaci\u00f3n superior, las empresas y el Estado, en aras de lograr un nivel m\u00e1s alto de competitividad y desarrollo. Estos lineamientos constituyen una pauta que permitir\u00e1 expandir la discusi\u00f3n y generar una serie de pol\u00edticas p\u00fablicas conducentes a fortalecer la investigaci\u00f3n en las instituciones de educaci\u00f3n superior y promover investigaciones m\u00e1s pertinentes para el pa\u00eds en el mediano y largo plazo.",

            "abstract": "Mannheimiosis or pneumonic pasteurellosis commonly occurs in small ruminants. Mannheimiosis is caused by Mannheimia haemolytica (M. haemolytica) a Gram-negative coccobacillus producing acute febrile and infectious condition resulting in death of animal if not diagnosed and treated promptly. M. haemolytica serotype A2 is a commensal of the nasopharynx, gaining access to the lungs when host defenses are compromised by stress or infection in small ruminants. Till date, there is a vast literature and research that has been conducted on the pathogenesis of M. haemolytica invariably on respiratory system and its related immune system and mechanisms. From the clinical point of view, infection or diseases involving vital organs will systemically affect the production and performance of the infected animal. Therefore, there is a huge gap of knowledge and research to answer the question whether there is any association between M. haemolytica infection with reproductive physiology and performance in small ruminants and how it affects the productivity level. This review will explore the possibilities of involvement and new potential research to be carried out to determine the involvement of male and female reproductive system with M. haemolytica infection among small ruminants.",

            "abstract": "Background: The diagnosis of multidrug resistant and extensively drug resistant tuberculosis is a global health priority. Whole genome sequencing of clinical Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates promises to circumvent the long wait times and limited scope of conventional phenotypic antimicrobial susceptibility, but gaps remain for predicting phenotype accurately from genotypic data especially for certain drugs. Our primary aim was to perform an exploration of statistical learning algorithms and genetic predictor sets using a rich dataset to build a high performing and fast predicting model to detect anti-tuberculosis drug resistance. Methods: We collected targeted or whole genome sequencing and conventional drug resistance phenotyping data from 3601 Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains enriched for resistance to first- and second-line drugs, with 1228 multidrug resistant strains. We investigated the utility of (1) rare variants and variants known to be determinants of resistance for at least one drug and (2) machine and statistical learning architectures in predicting phenotypic drug resistance to 10 anti-tuberculosis drugs. Specifically, we investigated multitask and single task wide and deep neural networks, a multilayer perceptron, regularized logistic regression, and random forest classifiers. Findings: The highest performing machine and statistical learning methods included both rare variants and those known to be causal of resistance for at least one drug. Both simpler L2 penalized regression and complex machine learning models had high predictive performance. The average AUCs for our highest performing model was 0.979 for first-line drugs and 0.936 for second-line drugs during repeated cross-validation. On an independent validation set, the highest performing model showed average AUCs, sensitivities, and specificities, respectively, of 0.937, 87.9%, and 92.7% for first-line drugs and 0.891, 82.0% and 90.1% for second-line drugs. Our method outperforms existing approaches based on direct association, with increased sum of sensitivity and specificity of 11.7% on first line drugs and 3.2% on second line drugs. Our method has higher predictive performance compared to previously reported machine learning models during cross-validation, with higher AUCs for 8 of 10 drugs. Interpretation: Statistical models, especially those that are trained using both frequent and less frequent variants, significantly improve the accuracy of resistance prediction and hold promise in bringing sequencing technologies closer to the bedside.

AGV implantation with adjunctive subconjunctival bevacizumab (1.25 mg) was performed with satisfactory results during the first postoperative week. However, 10 days after surgery, she developed wound dehiscence and tube exposure. The second case was a 33-year-old man with history of congenital glaucoma and uncontrolled IOP who developed AGV exposure and wound dehiscence after surgery. In both cases, for prevention of endophthalmitis and corneal damage by the unstable tube, the shunt was removed and the conjunctiva was re-sutured.\nConclusion: The potential adverse effect of subconjunctival bevacizumab injection on wound healing should be considered in AGV surgery.",

AGV implantation with adjunctive subconjunctival bevacizumab (1.25 mg) was performed with satisfactory results during the first postoperative week. However, 10 days after surgery, she developed wound dehiscence and tube exposure. The second case was a 33-year-old man with history of congenital glaucoma and uncontrolled IOP who developed AGV exposure and wound dehiscence after surgery. In both cases, for prevention of endophthalmitis and corneal damage by the unstable tube, the shunt was removed and the conjunctiva was re-sutured.\nConclusion: The potential adverse effect of subconjunctival bevacizumab injection on wound healing should be considered in AGV surgery.",

Se escogi\u00f3 el periodo de 1980 a 2006 para describir su evoluci\u00f3n, destac\u00e1ndose algunos aspectos relevantes de esa trayectoria. Se trata de un estudio documental, descriptivo-reflexivo y de sondaje cualitativo. La lectura de documentos como: Decretos Ministeriales inherentes a la Atenci\u00f3n B\u00e1sica, Normas T\u00e9cnicas, informes del DATASUS, informes del Programa de la Salud de la Familia, informes de evaluaci\u00f3n de realizaci\u00f3n de metas de los indicadores pactados para la Atenci\u00f3n B\u00e1sica (SISPACTO), T\u00e9rminos de Habilitaci\u00f3n Municipal, informes de gesti\u00f3n provincial, Plan Provincial de Salud y Convenio del PROESF, posibilitaron una visi\u00f3n m\u00e1s contextualizada de los diferentes enfoques abordados en estos documentos y los avances obtenidos. Se pudo concluir que los procesos de evaluaci\u00f3n en salud a\u00fan son incipientes, poco incorporados a las pr\u00e1cticas de los servicios de salud, obsoletos, burocr\u00e1ticos y punitivos e incluso no subsidiarios de la planificaci\u00f3n y gesti\u00f3n.",

            "abstract": "O Grande Salto para Frente foi um programa econ&amp;ocirc;mico e s&amp;oacute;ciopol&amp;iacute;tico lan&amp;ccedil;ado pelo Presidente Mao Zedong, do Partido Comunista Chin&amp;ecirc;s, entre 1958 e 1960, para transformar a China de um pa&amp;iacute;s agr&amp;aacute;rio e atrasado em um pa&amp;iacute;s industrial, avan&amp;ccedil;ado e verdadeiramente socialista. Por falta de planejamento e coordena&amp;ccedil;&amp;atilde;o, por causa da resist&amp;ecirc;ncia dos camponeses e de uma s&amp;eacute;rie de erros pol&amp;iacute;ticos, este programa radical e altamente ut&amp;oacute;pico acabou sendo um grande salto para tr&amp;aacute;s.O colapso do Grande Salto para Frente e a conseq&amp;uuml;ente fome e depress&amp;atilde;o na China tiveram um grande impacto sobre a pol&amp;iacute;tica partid&amp;aacute;ria do pa&amp;iacute;s. Desde 1962, o partido e o seu presidente come&amp;ccedil;aram a se distanciar, o que conduziu &amp;agrave; forma&amp;ccedil;&amp;atilde;o de duas fac&amp;ccedil;&amp;otilde;es dentro do Partido Comunista Chin&amp;ecirc;s: a fac&amp;ccedil;&amp;atilde;o radical mao&amp;iacute;sta, que se encontrava isolada, e a fac&amp;ccedil;&amp;atilde;o moderada e &amp;ldquo;revisionista&amp;rdquo;, que estava no comando efetivo. O conflito aberto entre as duas fac&amp;ccedil;&amp;otilde;es aconteceria a partir de 1966, quando Mao lan&amp;ccedil;ou a Revolu&amp;ccedil;&amp;atilde;o Cultural &amp;ndash; objeto dos meus futuros estudos.<br>The Great Leap Forward consisted of an economical, social and political program introduced by President Mao Zedong of the Chinese Communist Party between 1958 and 1960 to transform China from an agricultural and backward country into an industrial, progressive and really socialist one. Due to lack of planning and coordination, peasants&amp;rsquo; resistance and political mistakes, this extreme and highly utopian program actually became a great backward leap. The collapse of the Great Leap Forward and the consequent famine and depression in China affected immensely the country&amp;rsquo;s party politics. Since a gap was established as from 1962 between the party and its president, two rival blocs became extant within the Chinese Communist Party: the Maoist radical bloc which remained alone, and the moderate and &amp;ldquo;revisionist&amp;rdquo; bloc which was actually in command. Open war between the two blocs occurred in 1966 when Mao triggered the Cultural Revolution.",

            "abstract": "In Italy, 90 local avian breeds were described; the majority (61%) were classified as extinct and only 8.9% as still widely spread. Therefore, efforts for conservation of Italian avian breeds are urgently required. The aim of this study was to record the breeding performance of the Italian breed Mericanel della Brianza to multiply a small population, in order to develop a conservation programme. Fourteen females and eight males were available at the beginning of the reproductive season in 2009 and organised into eight families (1 male\/1-2 females) kept in floor pens. Birds received a photoperiod of 14L:10D and were fed ad libitum. Breeding performance was recorded from March to June. Egg production and egg weight were recorded daily; eggs were set every two weeks and fertility, embryo mortality and hatchability were recorded. Mean egg production was 37% and mean egg weight was 34\u00b13.49 g. High fertility values from 94% to 87% were recorded in the first three settings and the overall mean fertility value was 81.6%. Overall hatchability was only 49.6% owing to a high proportion of dead embryos. Embryo mortality occurred mainly between days 2 and 7 of incubation and during hatching. The highest hatchability values were recorded in settings 1 and 2, 69% and 60% respectively, and a large decrease was found in the subsequent settings. Marked variations in egg production, fertility, hatchability and embryo mortality were found among families. The present results represent the basic know ledge of reproductive parameters necessary to improve the reproductive efficiency of the breed within a conservation plan.",

Data were analyzed using the t-test and x2 test.\nFindings: There was no significant difference between either OCs and non-OCs\nusers or HRT and non-HRT groups in terms of mean BMI, number of pregnancies and\ndietary intakes of vitamin A and fiber. Mean serum vitamin A level in OCs Users was\nsignificantly (p<0. 001) higher than that of non \u2013 OCs users (79.97\u00b123.56 \u03bcg\/dl vs.\n64.56\u00b122.15 \u03bcg\/dl). There was no significant difference between HRT and non-HRT\ngroups in terms of mean serum vitamin A level (71.76\u00b115.91 \u03bcg\/dl and 67.65\u00b122.39\n\u03bcg\/dl respectively). There was a significant (P<0.004) relationship between serum\nVitamin A status and use of OCs analyzed using x2 test. This test did not show\nsignificant relationship in postmenopausal women.\nConclusions: Using OCs and subsequent hormonal alteration are an effective factor\nfor increasing serum vitamin A level in childbearing aged women. Taking HRT has\nnot resulted in altered vitamin A levels in postmenopausal women.",

            "abstract": "Mutations in the m.13094T>C MT-ND5 gene have been previously described in three cases of Leigh Syndrome (LS). In this retrospective, international cohort study we identified 20 clinically affected individuals (13 families) and four asymptomatic carriers. Ten patients were deceased at the time of analysis (median age of death was 10\u00a0years (range: 5\u00b74\u00a0months\u221237\u00a0years, IQR\u00a0=\u00a017\u00b79\u00a0years). Nine patients manifested with LS, one with mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes (MELAS), and one with Leber hereditary optic neuropathy. The remaining nine patients presented with either overlapping syndromes or isolated neurological symptoms. Mitochondrial respiratory chain activity analysis was normal in five out of ten muscle biopsies. We confirmed maternal inheritance in six families, and demonstrated marked variability in tissue segregation, and phenotypic expression at relatively low blood mutant loads. Neuropathological studies of two patients manifesting with LS\/MELAS showed prominent capillary proliferation, microvacuolation and severe neuronal cell loss in the brainstem and cerebellum, with conspicuous absence of basal ganglia involvement. These findings suggest that whole mtDNA genome sequencing should be considered in patients with suspected mitochondrial disease presenting with complex neurological manifestations, which would identify over 300 known pathogenic variants including the m.13094T>C.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the type of dizziness and its relationship with psychological disorders in patients with chronic complaints. 179 patients with a range of 18 to 65 years were studied. Patients were asked to complete the revised questionnaire form that contained 90 questions related to the signs based on severity scale vertigo tool. Subsequently to detect organic or non-organic vertigo, the patients were divided into two groups. Patients were asked to complete the given questionnaire form. For psychiatric disorders screening questions of international standard for testing SCL-90-R were used. Vertigo severity scale was used for the evaluation of dizziness severity. To compare quantitative variables between the two groups independent t-Test was used and p value of \u22640.05 was considered as significant. Of the total population 70.9% were females. 74% of patients have had dizziness due to organic causes and 26% have had dizziness due to non-organic causes. Dimension scores related to somatic complaints, obsessive-compulsive, depression, anxiety, paranoid ideation and global severity index in individuals with non-organic vertigo was significantly higher than other groups. There was a significant direct relationship between the overall score related to intensity of dizziness and all of the questionnaire dimensions'. There was significant correlation between the extent of physical complaints and the fear for morbid (p&lt;0.001). The score of extent related to dizziness\/balance in patient with vertigo due to organic causes and score of extent related to autonomic\/anxiety in patient with vertigo due to non-organic causes was significantly higher than other groups.<\/p>",

However, this information varies between institutions, limiting its value in comparing individuals and fairly assessing their quality. This study investigates what is included in candidates\u2019 documentation, the heterogeneity therein, as well as its objective data. Methods: Samples of recent transcripts and Medical Student Performance Records were anonymised prior to evaluation. Data were then extracted by two independent reviewers blinded to the submitting university, assessing for the presence of pre-selected criteria; disagreement was resolved through consensus. The data were subsequently analysed in multiple subgroups. Results: Inter-rater agreement equalled 92%. Inclusion of important criteria varied by school, ranging from 22.2% inclusion to 70.4%; the mean equalled 47.4%. The frequency of specific criteria was highly variable as well. Only 17.7% of schools provided any basis for comparison of academic performance; the majority detailed only status regarding pass or fail, without any further qualification. Conclusions: Considerable heterogeneity exists in the information provided in official medical school documentation, as well as markedly little objective data. Standardization may be necessary in order to facilitate fair comparison of graduates from different institutions. Implementation of objective data may allow more effective intra- and inter-scholastic comparison.",

Several reports have shown that a compatible monokaryon pair needs to mate; producing dikaryotic mycelia to initiate the infection towards the oil palm. However, the molecular events occurs during mating process are not well understood. We performed transcriptome sequencing using Illumina RNA-seq technology and de novo assembly of the transcripts from monokaryon, mating junction and dikaryon mycelia of G. boninense. Raw reads from these three libraries were deposited in the NCBI database with accession number SRR1745787, SRR1745773 and SRR1745777, respectively.",

FMT-XCT, MSOT and fluorescence cryosection imaging were performed.\nConcentrations up to 10\u00a0\u03bcg DiR\/ml did not cause apoptosis in vitro (p\u00a0>\u00a00.05). FMT and MSOT imaging of labeled MSCs led to a strong signal. The imaging modalities highlighted a difference in cell distribution and concentration correlated to the number of injected cells. Ex-vivo cryosectioning confirmed the molecular fluorescence signal.\nFMT and MSOT are sensitive imaging techniques offering high-anatomic resolution in terms of detection and distribution of intramyocardially injected stem cells in a rabbit model.",

            "abstract": "Despite the rising commodification of heritage sites and practices, children engagement in their own cultures remains incredibly low, greatly endangering the future preservation of nations\u2019 unique nonrenewable resource. Considering children\u2019s very early engagement with cultural attitudes and identities, it is increasingly critical to develop a deeply rooted culture of responsibility and conservation from the earliest years, ensuring that children naturally feel invested in their surroundings. Unfortunately, heritage education remains largely undervalued, with most efforts relying on in-person experiences in formal cultural institutions. This paper thus aims to explore how heritage education can be redefined, using some of the most innovative virtual imaging and artificial reality technologies to at once expand access and engagement with one\u2019s own history. Though there have been introductory applications of this edutainment multimedia technology, it will require a multidisciplinary team to create heritage programming which is as entertaining as it is intellectually challenging for young children. With the rich resources of 3D imaging and interactive programming already at our disposal, we are well-equipped to do so, given a coordinated effort.",

            "abstract": "Urine as a true non-invasive sampling source holds great potential for biomarker discovery. While approximately 2000 proteins can be detected by mass spectrometry in urine from healthy people, the amount of these proteins vary considerably. A systematic evaluation of a large number of samples is needed to determine the range of the variations. Current biomarker studies often measure limited number of urine samples in the discovery phase, which makes it difficult to determine whether proteins differentially expressed between control and disease groups represent actual difference, or are just physiological variations among the individuals, leads to failures in the validation phase with the increased sample numbers. Here, we report a streamlined workflow with capacity of measuring 8 urine proteomes per day at the coverage of >1500 proteins. With this workflow, we evaluated variations in 497 urine proteomes from 167 healthy donors, establishing reference intervals (RIs) that covered urine protein variations. We demonstrated that RIs could be used to monitor physiological changes by detecting transient outlier proteins. Furthermore, we provided a RIs-based algorithm for biomarker discovery and validation to screen for diseases such as cancer. This study provided a proof-of-principle workflow for the use of urine proteome for health monitoring and disease screening.",

Treatment of acute attack of asthma is short acting b 2 agonist such as Albuterol that is used via a nebulizer or Metered-dose inhaler (MDI) with and attached spacer. Object of this study was evaluation of therapeutic effects of Albuterol via a nebulizer or MDI with an attached holding chamber in patients that had been referred to Emergency departement of Mobasher Hospital in Hamadan.  Materials and methods: The present study was a clinical trial (before and after) in 60 patients that were suffered from acute attack asthma. Inclusion criterias were 16-65 years old age patients, FEV1, below 60% of predicted value, and cooperation for spirometry performance. Exclusion criterias were COPD, cardiovascular disorders, pneumonia, preumothorex, or their systemic or pulmonary disorders,severe respiratory failure with cyanosis or confusion, pregnancy and smoking. On arrival to the ED, all patients underwent spirometery and all of patients received oxygen and a single dose of 8 mg intravenous dexamethasone. Immediately thereafter patients were randomized to two groups.The study was designed as double blind trial. The first group patients received four puffs Albuterol attached to spacer and immediately distilled water via nebulizer. The second group patientts received 5 mg Albuterol solution via nebulizer after administration of placebo inhaler attached to holding chamber. All of the patients received a total of four treatment. The first dose was administered immediately after spirometry and then every 30 minutes. Spirometry was performed at entry between to the study and then 15 minutes after each treatment.  Results: Analysis of comparison of bronchodilating effects of salbutamol via nebulizer or MDI with attached to spacer showed similar effects in two methods (P>0.05). FEV1, FVC, FEV1\/FVC changes were significant among four treatments in every group (P<0.05) but there was no difference between two methods among four treatments (P<0.05).  Conclusion: A short acting b 2-agonist such as Albuterol can be administer in patients with acute attack asthma with every two methods (nebulizer or MDI with attached spacer) and have similar bronchodilating effect.",

            "abstract": "Background: Theophylline is one of the oldest drugs that is used to treat asthma and COPD. Theophylline metabolism can alter by some of the drugs and diseases. Severe theophylline side effects are usually related to plasma concentration higher than 20 mg\/L. The present study was done to determine aminophylline clearance and the drug use evaluation in Afzalipour hospital.   Materials and Methods: In this cross-sectional study 21 asthmatic or COPD patients were enrolled. 2 blood samples were drawn at 15 minutes and 24 hrs after completing aminophylline loading dose and starting maintenance dose infusion. Serum theophylline concentration were determined using HPLC and drug clearance was calculated by Chiou methods and compared with theophylline clearance based on population pharmacokinetic study.   Results: Mean patients age were 57\u00b118 years. Mean theophylline concentration in the two samples were 9.1\u00b14 and 5.1 \u00b13.3 mg\/L respectively. Our patients clearance was 4.2\u00b12.2 L\/hr and there was no statistically significant difference with theophylline clearance (3.1\u00b11) based on population pharmacokinetic study (P=0.075).   Conclusion: Based on our study there was not rational and logical usage of aminophylline in the our patiens. In 62% of the patients\u2019 serum, theophylline level were less than 5 mg\/L. It is suggested that Therapeutic Drug Monitoring must be used in patients who receive intravenous aminophylline specifically in the critically ill patients, to prevent drug toxicity and to ensure about drug efficacy.",

The molecular mechanism(s) underlying this exocrinopathy is not known, although the syndrome has been associated with viruses, such as the Epstein Barr Virus (EBV). We report herein that an EBV-specific microRNA (ebv-miR-BART13-3p) is significantly elevated in salivary glands (SGs) of pSS patients and we show that it targets stromal interacting molecule 1 (STIM1), a primary regulator of the store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE) pathway that is essential for SG function, leading to loss of SOCE and Ca2+-dependent activation of NFAT. Although EBV typically infects B cells and not salivary epithelial cells, ebv-miR-BART13-3p is present in both cell types in pSS SGs. Importantly, we further demonstrate that ebv-miR-BART13-3p can be transferred from B cells to salivary epithelial cells through exosomes and it recapitulates its functional effects on calcium signaling in a model system.",

            "abstract": "At our center, relapsed mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) can be treated with maintenance therapy composed of consecutive low-dose lenalidomide and short-term, high-dose dexamethasone (LD regimen), which achieves good responses (longer overall survival and progression-free survival) and low toxicity. Cereblon is probably targeted by both lenalidomide and dexamethasone, which leads to synergistic cytotoxicity in MCL by inhibiting the interleukin-6\/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (IL-6\/STAT3), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)\/AKT and AKT2\/Forkhead box O3 (FOXO3A)\/BCL2-like 11 (BIM) pathways. The two drugs synergistically inhibit the same pathways, but through different sites. Cereblon was found expressed in most of the MCL tissues (91.3% positivity). Moreover, cereblon expression is positively correlated with LD regimen sensitivity: long-term lenalidomide exposure downregulates cereblon and induces multi-drug resistance against lenalidomide, dexamethasone, cytarabine, cisplatin, and methotrexate in vitro. Removal of lenalidomide resensitizes lenalidomide-resistant MCL cells to lenalidomide and dexamethasone. Our work suggests that rotating the LD regimen with other regimens would improve MCL maintenance therapy.",

            "abstract": "The characterisation of anthropogenic climate change as a violation of basic human rights is gaining wide recognition. Many people believe that tackling this problem is exclusively the job of governments and supranational institutions (especially the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change). This argument can be traced back to the delegated authority model, according to which the legitimacy of political institutions depends on their ability to solve problems that are difficult to address at the individual level. Since the institutions created to tackle climate change fail to do so, their legitimacy is under great pressure and can only be saved by considerations of feasibility. We argue that democratically elected representatives are able to claim that a more robust climate policy is unfeasible, but only because the mandate we as citizens grant them is very restrictive. Instead of shifting responsibility for the thoroughly inadequate response to climate change fully to political representatives, we should highlight the failure of the political community as a whole to fulfil its responsibility at the input-side of the delegation of authority. When individual voters fail to fulfil the minimal obligation to at least vote for parties that explicitly advocate robust climate policies, they cannot hide behind the delegated authority argument, but should accept their complicity in the massive violations of basic human rights caused by the failure to successfully tackle climate change.",

The results show that among the characteristics of poultry, meat consumers assign greater importance to those that are strictly related to animal welfare issues. Price and product appearance (i.e., colour, presence of fat) come in second. To meet these needs, producers can effectively operate along the supply chain by acting on poultry housing type, genotype lines, and stocking density. Information about these issues should then be shared with the consumers (<em>i.e.<\/em>, clear product labelling).",

This study was designed to investigate the ethanolic extract effect of the root of Taraxacum Syriacum (TSBE) on Acetaminophen-induced nephro-toxicity.\nMaterials and Methods: The root of Taraxacum Syriacum Boiss were analysed using SPME-GC\/MS (Solid Phase Microextraction). In this experimental study, 30 male rats were randomly divided into 5 groups (n=6). The rats were treated firstly with different doses of TSBE (50,100 and 200 mg\/kg, p.o.) daily for 7 days then they intraperitoneally were injected with 700 mg\/kg Acetaminophen. Water was administered to the control group for seven days. Toxic (Acetaminophen) group received water for seven days and on day 7, 700 mg\/kg Acetaminophen was intraperitoneally injected. Twenty-four hours after the Acetaminophen administration, animals were anaesthetized and blood was collected from the heart for assaying serum creatinine. Kidneys were removed, then cut off and placed in 10% formalin for histopathology assessment.\nResults: 21 chemical components of Taraxacum Syriacum Boiss root including 1,1-dimethyldiborane, 1-propene 3-ethoxy, 3,5-octadien-2-one, nonanal, decanal, nonanoic acid and carvacrol were identified and extracted. Creatinine reduced significantly in the experiment group (TSBE 200 mg\/kg) in comporison with the toxic group. Also, in histopathology assessment, kidney necrosis reduced in experimental groups (TSBE 100, 200 mg\/kg).\nConclusion: TSBE seems to have a protective role in Acetaminophen induced nephro-toxicity and the role of phenolic compounds such as carvacrol is important.",

This study was designed to investigate the ethanolic extract effect of the root of Taraxacum Syriacum (TSBE) on Acetaminophen-induced nephro-toxicity.\nMaterials and Methods: The root of Taraxacum Syriacum Boiss were analysed using SPME-GC\/MS (Solid Phase Microextraction). In this experimental study, 30 male rats were randomly divided into 5 groups (n=6). The rats were treated firstly with different doses of TSBE (50,100 and 200 mg\/kg, p.o.) daily for 7 days then they intraperitoneally were injected with 700 mg\/kg Acetaminophen. Water was administered to the control group for seven days. Toxic (Acetaminophen) group received water for seven days and on day 7, 700 mg\/kg Acetaminophen was intraperitoneally injected. Twenty-four hours after the Acetaminophen administration, animals were anaesthetized and blood was collected from the heart for assaying serum creatinine. Kidneys were removed, then cut off and placed in 10% formalin for histopathology assessment.\nResults: 21 chemical components of Taraxacum Syriacum Boiss root including 1,1-dimethyldiborane, 1-propene 3-ethoxy, 3,5-octadien-2-one, nonanal, decanal, nonanoic acid and carvacrol were identified and extracted. Creatinine reduced significantly in the experiment group (TSBE 200 mg\/kg) in comporison with the toxic group. Also, in histopathology assessment, kidney necrosis reduced in experimental groups (TSBE 100, 200 mg\/kg).\nConclusion: TSBE seems to have a protective role in Acetaminophen induced nephro-toxicity and the role of phenolic compounds such as carvacrol is important.",

Moreover, the measure of roughness of soft set is defined in MSR-approximation space and the order relation is introduced on soft set. Furthermore, lattice theory is studied in the MSR-approximation space under a modified rough soft environment.

Empleamos diez redes de niebla durante 12\/mes\/sitio, acumulando un esfuerzo de muestreo de 1,440 horas\/red por sitio. Pesamos 56 individuos. No encontramos diferencias significativas entre sexos. Analizamos la influencia del tiempo de abandono y la estacionalidad en la variaci\u00f3n del peso de C. passerina usando una ANDEVA factorial. El peso promedio fue de 39 g. La estacionalidad tuvo un efecto en la diferencia de pesos, pero la edad de abandono no. En las parcelas con menos a\u00f1os de abandono capturamos el 96% de los individuos, lo que quiz\u00e1 se deba a que la abundancia de especies de plantas con semillas peque\u00f1as se presente en las primeras etapas sucesionales. Los mayores pesos se encontraron en la \u00e9poca de lluvias, cuando casi todas las especies de plantas producen semillas, ya que \u00e9ste es un ecosistema estacional. En ecorregiones altamente productivas de Centroam\u00e9rica se encontraron pesos de entre 30 y 35 g para la especie, lo que sugiere que los ecosistemas m\u00e1s productivos no necesariamente tienen m\u00e1s recursos para esta especie.",

However, it remains unknown as to which is the most effective distributed practice schedule for learning bronchoscopy skills through simulation training. This study compares two distributed practice schedules: One-day distributed practice and weekly distributed practice. Method: Twenty physicians in training were randomly assigned to one-day distributed or weekly distributed bronchoscopy simulation practice. Performance was assessed with a pre-test, a post-test after each practice session, and a 4-week retention test using previously validated simulator measures. Data were analysed with repeated measures ANOVA. Results: No interaction was found between group and test (F(4,72) <1.68, p>0.16), except for the measure \u2018percent-segments-entered\u2019, and no main effect of group was found for any of the measures (F(1,72)< 0.87, p>0.36), which indicates that there was no difference between the learning curves of the one-day distributed practice schedule and the weekly distributed practice schedule. Discussion: We found no difference in effectiveness of bronchoscopy skills acquisition between the one-day distributed practice and the weekly distributed practice. This finding suggests that the choice of bronchoscopy training practice may be guided by what best suits the clinical practice.",

BCL11A (B cell lymphoma 11A) plays a vital role in the evolutionarily different globin gene switches of mammals. In the current study, siRNA complementary to BCL11A was used to inhibit the BCL11A gene expression in erythroleukemic K562 cells and the expression was evaluated through real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and western blot analysis. On day 7 of cell culture, 1x106 K562 cells were transfected with lipofectamine containing BCL11A specific siRNA. GAPDH (Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase) was used as the reference gene to confirm the relative expression level of BCL11A gene mRNA and BCL11A protein. After 48 h of transfection, BCL11A specific siRNA produced significantly reduction of BCL11A mRNA level in a dose-dependent manner. It also affects the level of BCL11A protein. BCL11A siRNAs were equally effective at reducing the expression level of BCL11A mRNA and protein.",

            "abstract": "<p class=\"Style12\">To determine effects of birth weight (BtW) and feeding system on fattening performance and behavioural responses of lambs, after birth 28 Karayaka male lambs were divided into two BtW groups, namely a low BtW (4.1\u00b10.06 kg) and high BtW (5.0\u00b10.09 kg). After weaning (90 days of age), seven lambs in each of these groups were fed individually <em>ad libitum<\/em> with total mixed ratio (TMR), consisted of 80% of a compound feed and 20% of roughage based on a dry matter basis (140 g crude protein and 2550 kcal ME\/kg) and the other seven lambs were fed on the same ingredients as that of TMR but each ingredient was put in separate troughs (free choice feeding, FCF). Therefore the lambs were distributed into four groups according to 2 (low <em>vs<\/em> high BtW) \u00d7 2 (TMR <em>vs<\/em> FCF) factorial design. Live weight gains and intakes of dry matter, feedstuffs and nutrients of the lambs were affected by the FCF, but not by the BtW and their interaction. The daily weight gain (P&lt;0.01), intakes of soybean meal and corn (P&lt;0.01), dry matter (P&lt;0.05), protein and energy (P&lt;0.01) of FCF-fed lambs were higher than those of TMR-fed lambs. FCF-fed lambs consumed less alfalfa hay, wheat bran and barley than TMR-fed lambs (P&lt;0.01). The FCF increased rumination (P&lt;0.01) and tend to rest more (P&lt;0.05) compared to the TMR. The study suggests that FCF system can assist in enhancing the live weight gain by promoting the protein and energy intakes and by improving the welfare of lambs.<span style=\"font-size: 10px;\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>",

            "abstract": "A 291 bp short interspersed nuclear element (SINE) insertion in the porcine <em>vertnin<\/em> (<em>VRTN<\/em>) gene on porcine chromosome 7 was shown to affect vertebral number and several production traits: allele Q (with the insertion) increases vertebral number compared to the wild type allele (WT, without insertion). In this study we genotyped this polymorphism in eight pig breeds (Italian Large White, Italian Duroc, Italian Landrace, <em>Cinta Senese<\/em>, <em>Mora Romagnola<\/em>, <em>Casertana<\/em>, <em>Apulo Calabrese<\/em>, and <em>Nero Siciliano<\/em>) and in Italian wild boars to evaluate allele frequency distribution of the two alleles. Allele Q was the most frequent in Italian Landrace and Italian Duroc (0.738 and 0.545, respectively) whereas it was the less frequent in all other breeds and was absent in wild boars. Association study was carried out in two Italian Large White samples. These two groups of animals were constituted by performance tested pigs for which estimated breeding values (EBV) and random residuals (RR) for several traits (average daily gain, back fat thickness, feed:gain ratio, lean cuts and ham weight) were calculated: i) 270 pigs chosen without any criteria (random group), that were also measured for several meat quality traits; ii) 560 gilts with extreme and divergent EBV for back fat thickness. For these animals vertebral number was not available. Results of the association analyses indicated that allele Q was associated with a lower ham weight, confirming indirectly, the negative correlation reported by other studies between vertebral number and this trait. No other trait was associated with the analysed <em>VRTN<\/em> polymorphism.",

            "abstract": "Experimental studies show a substantial contribution of early life environment to obesity risk through epigenetic processes. We examined inter-individual DNA methylation differences in human birth tissues associated with child's adiposity. We identified a novel association between the level of CpG methylation at birth within the promoter of the long non-coding RNA ANRIL (encoded at CDKN2A) and childhood adiposity at age 6-years. An association between ANRIL methylation and adiposity was also observed in three additional populations; in birth tissues from ethnically diverse neonates, in peripheral blood from adolescents, and in adipose tissue from adults. Additionally, CpG methylation was associated with ANRIL expression in vivo, and CpG mutagenesis in vitro inhibited ANRIL promoter activity. Furthermore, CpG methylation enhanced binding to an Estrogen Response Element within the ANRIL promoter. Our findings demonstrate that perinatal methylation at loci relevant to gene function may be a robust marker of later adiposity, providing substantial support for epigenetic processes in mediating long-term consequences of early life environment on human health.",

            "abstract": "Inactivation of the androgen receptor (AR) pathway by androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is the mainstay of (metastatic) prostate cancer therapy. Ultimately, the AR pathway will be re-activated despite castrate levels of circulating androgens. Thereby, maintaining its role even in castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). The recent STAMPEDE and CHAARTED trials showed that docetaxel in combination with ADT increased survival in hormone sensitive prostate cancer patients, suggesting cross-talk between AR signaling and chemotherapy efficacy. We hypothesized that a similar interaction may also apply for CRPC that is treated with cabazitaxel. We studied the impact of androgen status on the efficacy, pharmacodynamics and -kinetics of cabazitaxel in a unique and clinically relevant patient derived xenograft model of castration resistant disease. We found that cabazitaxel is highly effective in a castrate setting with strongly reduced AR activation, while tumor growth inhibition by cabazitaxel was completely abolished in the presence of high AR pathway activity. Moreover, additional experiments showed that intratumoral cabazitaxel levels were 3.5 times higher in tumors from castrated mice as compared to tumors from androgen-supplemented animals. We confirmed that cabazitaxel pharmacokinetics were not affected by testosterone, suggesting that androgen status might influence cabazitaxel tumor uptake directly. This study reveals the impact of androgen status on cabazitaxel efficacy and supports the potential of combination of taxane chemotherapeutics with AR axis targeting agents.",

            "abstract": "The climate and weather forecast predictive capability for precipitation intensity is limited by gaps in the understanding of basic cloud-convective processes. Currently, a better understanding of the cloud-convective process lacks observational constraints, due to the difficulty in obtaining accurate, vertically resolved pressure, temperature, and water vapor structure inside and near convective clouds. This manuscript describes the potential advantages of collecting sequential radio occultation (RO) observations from a constellation of closely spaced low Earth-orbiting satellites. In this configuration, the RO tangent points tend to cluster together, such that successive RO ray paths are sampling independent air mass quantities as the ray paths lie &#8220;parallel&#8221; to one another. When the RO train orbits near a region of precipitation, there is a probability that one or more of the RO ray paths will intersect the region of heavy precipitation, and one or more would lie outside. The presence of heavy precipitation can be discerned by the use of the polarimetric RO (PRO) technique recently demonstrated by the Radio Occultations through Heavy Precipitation (ROHP) receiver onboard the Spanish PAZ spacecraft. This sampling strategy provides unique, near-simultaneous observations of the water vapor profile inside and in the environment surrounding heavy precipitation, which are not possible from current RO data.",

A finite element model of such a system with an integral squeeze film bearing damper (ISFBD) is developed. The stability, energy distribution, and vibration control of the unbalanced single-side cantilevered rotor system are calculated and analyzed based on the finite element model. The stiffness of the integral squeeze film bearing damper is designed using theoretical calculation and finite element model (FEM) simulation. The influence of installation position and quantity of integral squeeze film bearing dampers on the vibration control of the unbalanced cantilevered rotor system is discussed. An experimental platform is developed to validate the vibration control effect. The results show that the installation position and quantity of the integral squeeze film bearing dampers have different effects on the stability, energy distribution, and vibration control of the unbalanced cantilevered rotor system. When ISFBDs are installed at both bearing housings, the vibration control is best, and the vibration components of the time and frequency domains have good vibration control effects in four working conditions.",

These areas are in need of improvement, particularly in regard to old housing and poor infrastructure. It is imperative that infrastructure conditions that may be difficult to focus on in the private sector are improved. Therefore, the public (Seoul Metropolitan Government (SMG)) needs to play an active role, with a particular focus on providing significant administrative power and finances to these areas in order to reduce the effects of policy failure and make continuous efforts to reverse the failed policy. The public should actively work to resolve distrust and conflict in the public policy and make restorative efforts through new policies.",

            "abstract": "Calcia-alumina binary compounds doped with rare earths and some transition metals cations show persistent luminescence from the visible to the infrared range. Specifically, the blue light can be obtained through the Eu<sup>2+<\/sup> activator center in a potential host, such as dodecacalcium hepta-aluminate (Ca<sub>12<\/sub>Al<sub>14<\/sub>O<sub>33<\/sub>) and monocalcium aluminate (CaAl<sub>2<\/sub>O<sub>4<\/sub>). By doping with Nd<sup>3+<\/sup>, the persistent luminescence can be substantially prolonged; for this reason, the Eu\/Nd pair is a potential choice for developing long-lasting blue luminescence. Herein, the phase evolution of the calcia-alumina system via molten salt synthesis is reported as a function of the synthesis temperature and the atmospheric environment. The fraction of CaAl<sub>2<\/sub>O<sub>4<\/sub> phase increases when the temperature is higher. Synthesized microparticles of platelet-type morphology represent isolated nanostructured ceramic pieces. Under visible light, the particles are white. This indicates that the followed process solves the dark-gray coloring of phosphor when is synthesized in a reduced atmosphere at high temperature. As regards the synthesis mechanism, which is assisted by the molten flux, the dissolution&#8722;diffusion transport process is promoted at the surface of the alumina microparticles. In fact, the emission intensity can be modulated through the phase of the Eu-doped calcium-aluminate discrete platelets synthesized. Consequently, the photoluminescence intensity depends also on the oxidation state of the Eu ion. X-ray absorption near-edge structure and photoluminescence measurements corroborate the Eu reduction and the grain coarsening with the enhancement of the blue emission. The doped phosphors with Eu\/Nd show a broad and strong absorption in the region of 320&#8722;400 nm and a broad emission band at around 440 nm when they are excited in this absorption range. From a broader perspective, our findings prove that the Ca<sub>12<\/sub>Al<sub>14<\/sub>O<sub>33<\/sub> and CaAl<sub>2<\/sub>O<sub>4<\/sub> phases open new opportunities for research into the design of blue long-lasting emitters for a wide range of fields from ceramic to optoelectronic materials.",

However, no clear evidence exists to support or oppose HFNC use in immunocompromised patients. Thus, this meta-analysis aims to assess the effects of HFNC, compared to conventional oxygen therapy (COT) and noninvasive ventilation (NIV), on the outcomes in immunocompromised patients with ARF. The Pubmed, Embase and Cochrane databases were searched up to November 2018. <i>Materials and Methods<\/i>: Only clinical studies comparing the effect of HFNC with COT or NIV for immunocompromised patients with ARF were included. The outcome included the rate of intubation, mortality and length of stay (LOS). <i>Results<\/i>: A total of eight studies involving 1433 immunocompromised patients with ARF were enrolled. The pooled analysis showed that HFNC was significantly associated with a reduced intubation rate (risk ratio (RR), 0.83; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.74&#8722;0.94, <i>I<\/i><sup>2<\/sup> = 0%). Among subgroup analysis, HFNC was associated with a lower intubation rate than COT (RR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.75&#8722;0.95, <i>I<\/i><sup>2<\/sup> = 0%) and NIV (RR, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.40&#8722;0.86, <i>I<\/i><sup>2<\/sup> = 0%), respectively. However, there was no significant difference between HFNC and control groups in terms of 28-day mortality (RR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.58&#8722;1.04, <i>I<\/i><sup>2<\/sup> = 48%), and intensive care unit (ICU) mortality (RR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.73&#8722;1.05, <i>I<\/i><sup>2<\/sup> = 57%). The ICU and hospital LOS were similar between HFNC and control groups (ICU LOS: mean difference, 0.49 days; 95% CI, &#8722;0.25&#8722;1.23, <i>I<\/i><sup>2<\/sup> = 69%; hospital LOS: mean difference, &#8722;0.12 days; 95% CI, &#8722;1.86&#8722;1.61, <i>I<\/i><sup>2<\/sup> = 64%). <i>Conclusions<\/i>: Use of HFNC may decrease the intubation rate in immunocompromised patients with ARF compared with the control group, including COT and NIV. However, HFNC could not provide additional survival benefit or shorten the LOS. Further large, randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm these findings.",

            "abstract": "In the desert locust <i>Schistocerca gregaria<\/i> (<i>S. gregaria<\/i>), pheromones are considered to be crucial for governing important behaviors and processes, including phase transition, reproduction, aggregation and swarm formation. The receptors mediating pheromone detection in olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) on the antenna of <i>S. gregaria<\/i> are unknown. Since pheromone receptors in other insects belong to the odorant receptor (OR) family and are typically co-expressed with the &#8220;sensory neuron membrane protein 1&#8221; (SNMP1), in our search for putative pheromone receptors of <i>S. gregaria<\/i>, we have screened the OR repertoire for receptor types that are expressed in SNMP1-positive OSNs. Based on phylogenetic analyses, we categorized the 119 ORs of <i>S. gregaria<\/i> into three groups (I&#8722;III) and analyzed a substantial number of ORs for co-expression with SNMP1 by two-color fluorescence in situ hybridization. We have identified 33 ORs that were co-expressed with SNMP1. In fact, the majority of ORs from group I and II were found to be expressed in SNMP1-positive OSNs, but only very few receptors from group III, which comprises approximately 60% of all ORs from <i>S. gregaria<\/i>, were co-expressed with SNMP1. These findings indicate that numerous ORs from group I and II could be important for pheromone communication. Collectively, we have identified a broad range of candidate pheromone receptors in <i>S. gregaria<\/i> that are not randomly distributed throughout the OR family but rather segregate into phylogenetically distinct receptor clades.",

            "abstract": "Environmental pollutants such as heavy metals and fungicides pose a serious threat to waterways worldwide. Toxicological assessment of such contaminants is usually conducted using single compound exposures, as it is challenging to understand the effect of mixtures on biota using standard ecotoxicological methods; whereas complex chemical mixtures are more probable in ecosystems. This study exposed <i>Simplisetia aequisetis<\/i> (an estuarine annelid) to sublethal concentrations of a metal (zinc) and a fungicide (boscalid), both singly and as a mixture, for two weeks. Metabolomic analysis via gas and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry was used to measure the stress response(s) of the organism following exposure. A total of 75 metabolites, including compounds contributing to the tricarboxylic acid cycle, the urea cycle, and a number of other pathways, were identified and quantified. The multiplatform approach identified distinct metabolomic responses to each compound that differed depending on whether the substance was presented singly or as a mixture, indicating a possible antagonistic effect. The study demonstrates that metabolomics is able to elucidate the effects and mode of action of contaminants and can identify possible outcomes faster than standard ecotoxicological endpoints, such as growth and reproduction. Metabolomics therefore has a possible future role in biomonitoring and ecosystem health assessments.",

We presumed to be true that income inequality entails stress and depression. Thus, these phenomena were tested as mediating factors. The data used consist of eight (8) area-based chronological variables: mortality rate, Gini index, disposable income, criminality rate, number of physicians, density of population, and the proportion of people reporting feeling stressed or depressed. The association between income inequality and mortality was analyzed using the generalized method of moments (GMM) approach with local fixed effects to control unobservable characteristics. Our results show that higher income inequality led to a significant increase of mortality rate with a time lag of 5 years when socioeconomic characteristics were held constant. As expected, households&#8217; disposable income and mortality rate were negatively associated. Moreover, mortality rate was positively associated with population density and negatively associated with the number of physicians. Finally, only depression showed the potential to act as a mediating factor. Based on our findings, we suggest that, over time, income inequality, by amplifying depression phenomena, increases the mortality rate in Quebec&#8217;s RCMs.",

            "abstract": "This study aims at combining time and quantity of carbohydrate (CH) intake in the definition of eating patterns in UK adults and investigating the association of the derived patterns with type 2 diabetes (T2D). The National Diet and Nutrition Survey (NDNS) Rolling Program included 6155 adults in the UK. Time of the day was categorized into 7 pre-defined time slots: 6&#8722;9 am, 9&#8722;12 noon, 12&#8722;2 pm, 2&#8722;5 pm, 5&#8722;8 pm, 8&#8722;10 pm, and 10 pm&#8722;6 am. Responses for CH intake were categorized into: no energy intake, CH &lt;50% or &#8805;50% of total energy. Non-parametric multilevel latent class analysis (MLCA) was applied to identify eating patterns of CH consumption across day-time, as a novel method accounting for the repeated measurements of intake over 3&#8722;4 days nested within individuals. Survey-designed multivariable regression was used to assess the associations of CH eating patterns with T2D. Three CH eating day patterns (low, high CH percentage and regular meal CH intake day) emerged from 24,483 observation days; based on which three classes of CH eaters were identified and characterized as: low (28.1%), moderate (28.8%) and high (43.1%) CH eaters. On average, low-CH eaters consumed the highest amount of total energy intake (7985.8 kJ) and had higher percentages of energy contributed by fat and alcohol, especially after 8 pm. Moderate-CH eaters consumed the lowest amount of total energy (7341.8 kJ) while they tended to have their meals later in the day. High-CH eaters consumed most of their carbohydrates and energy earlier in the day and within the time slots of 6&#8722;9 am, 12&#8722;2 p.m. and 5&#8722;8 pm, which correspond to traditional mealtimes. The high-CH eaters profile had the highest daily intake of CH and fiber and the lowest intake of protein and fat. Low-CH eaters had greater odds than high-CH eaters of having T2D in self-reported but not in previously undiagnosed diabetics. Further research using prospective longitudinal studies is warranted to ascertain the direction of causality in the association of CH patterns with type 2 diabetes.",

The significances of central nanodisks on the whole structure are studied first by varying the chemical potential. In addition, the effect of six graphene nanodisks placed in the ring on collective behaviors is also investigated. The influence of the nanodisks at different positions of the ring on the Fano resonance spectrum of the whole oligomer is researched by changing the chemical potential and radius. The proposed nanostructures may find broad applications in the fields of chemical and biochemical sensing.",

In order to determine the energy distribution, viscous dissipation is reckoned. Debye H&#252;ckel linearization and long wavelength assumptions are adopted. Resulting non-linear problem is analytically solved to examine the distribution and variation in velocity, temperature and volumetric flow rate within the Carreau fluid flow pattern through perturbation technique. This model is also suitable for a wide range of biological microfluidic applications and variation in velocity, temperature and volumetric flow rate within the Carreau fluid flow pattern.",

            "abstract": "The physical and chemical synthesis methods of quantum dots (QDs) are generally unfavorable for biological applications. To overcome this limitation, the development of a novel &#8220;green&#8221; route to produce highly-fluorescent CdSe QDs constitutes a promising substitute approach. In the present work, CdSe QDs were biosynthesized in yeast <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae<\/i> using a novel method, where we showed for the first time that the concentration of tryptone highly affects the synthesis process. The optimum concentration of tryptone was found to be 25 g\/L for the highest yield. Different methods were used to optimize the QD extraction from yeast, and the best method was found to be by denaturation at 80 &#176;C along with an ultrasound needle. Multiple physical characterizations including transmission electron microscopy (TEM), dynamic light scattering (DLS), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), and spectrophotometry confirmed the optical features size and shape distribution of the QDs. We showed that the novel conjugate of the CdSe QDs and a cell-penetrating peptide (hecate) can detect bacterial cells very efficiently under a fluorescent microscope. The conjugate also showed strong antibacterial activity against vancomycin-resistant <i>Staphylococcus aureus<\/i> (VRSA), methicillin-resistant <i>Staphylococcus aureus<\/i> (MRSA), and <i>Escherichia coli<\/i>, which may help us to cope with the problem of rising antibiotic resistance.",

            "abstract": "The evolution of modern power distribution systems into smart grids requires the development of dedicated state estimation (SE) algorithms for real-time identification of the overall system state variables. This paper proposes a strategy to evaluate the minimum number and best position of power injection meters in radial distribution systems for SE purposes. Measurement points are identified with the aim of reducing uncertainty in branch power flow estimations. An incremental heuristic meter placement (IHMP) approach is proposed to select the locations and total number of power measurements. The meter placement procedure was implemented for a backward\/forward load flow algorithm proposed by the authors, which allows the evaluation of medium-voltage power flows starting from low-voltage load measurements. This allows the reduction of the overall costs of measurement equipment and setup. The IHMP method was tested in the real 25-bus medium-voltage (MV) radial distribution network of the Island of Ustica (Mediterranean Sea). The proposed method is useful both for finding the best measurement configuration in a new distribution network and also for implementing an incremental enhancement of an existing measurement configuration, reaching a good tradeoff between instrumentation costs and measurement uncertainty.",

            "abstract": "Owing to its advantages over prior relevant technologies, massive parallel or next-generation sequencing (NGS) is rapidly evolving, with growing applications in a wide range of human diseases. The burst in actionable molecular alterations in many cancer types advocates for the practicality of using NGS in the clinical setting, as it permits the parallel characterization of multiple genes in a cost- and time-effective way, starting from low-input DNA. In advanced clinical practice, the oncological management of colorectal cancer requires prior knowledge of <i>KRAS<\/i>, <i>NRAS<\/i>, and <i>BRAF<\/i> status, for the design of appropriate therapeutic strategies, with more gene mutations still surfacing as potential biomarkers. Tumor heterogeneity, as well as the need for serial gene profiling due to tumor evolution and the emergence of novel genetic alterations, have promoted the use of liquid biopsies&#8212;especially in the form of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA)&#8212;as a promising alternative to tissue molecular analysis.

            "abstract": "This study explored the relationship between psychological contract breach and job insecurity or stress in employees engaged in the restaurant business. To do this, four hypotheses were proposed. First, job insecurity has a significant positive effect on psychological contract breach. Second, job insecurity has a significant positive effect on job stress. Third, psychological contract breach has a significant positive effect on job stress. Fourth, job insecurity has a significant positive effect on job stress via psychological contract breach. Then, eligible respondents (n = 384; 183 men and 201 women) were recruited from a total of five restaurant business companies and then evaluated for a self-administered questionnaire survey. Results showed not only that job insecurity had a significant positive effect on psychological contract breach and job stress but also that psychological contract breach had a significant positive effect on job stress and mediated the interaction between job insecurity and stress. It can therefore be concluded that restaurant business owners should establish rational criteria for compensating job insecurity and stress arising from psychological contract breach in employees engaged in the restaurant business because of an inconsistency between psychological contract breach arising from job insecurity and compensation for work performance of employees engaged in the restaurant business.",

            "abstract": "Background: In vitro cell culture monitoring can be used as an indicator of cellular oxidative stress for the assessment of different chemotherapy agents. Methods: A cell-based bioelectric biosensor was used to detect alterations in superoxide levels in the culture medium of HeLa cervical cancer cells after treatment with the chemotherapeutic agent 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). The cytotoxic effects of 5-fluorouracil on HeLa cells were assessed by the MTT proliferation assay, whereas oxidative damage and induction of apoptosis were measured fluorometrically by the mitochondria-targeted MitoSOX&#8482; Red and caspase-3 activation assays, respectively. Results: The results of this study indicate that 5-FU differentially affects superoxide production and caspase-3 activation when applied in cytotoxic concentrations against HeLa cells, while superoxide accumulation is in accordance with mitochondrial superoxide levels. Our findings suggest that changes in superoxide concentration could be detected with the biosensor in a non-invasive and rapid manner, thus allowing a reliable estimation of oxidative damage due to cell apoptosis. Conclusions: These findings may be useful for facilitating future high throughput screening of different chemotherapeutic drugs with a cytotoxic principle based on free radical production.",

            "abstract": "Posttranslational modifications (PTMs) exist in a wide variety of organisms and play key roles in regulating various essential biological processes. Lysine propionylation is a newly discovered PTM that has rarely been identified in fungi. Trichophyton rubrum (T. rubrum) is one of the most common fungal pathogens in the world and has been studied as an important model organism of anthropic pathogenic filamentous fungi. In this study, we performed a proteome-wide propionylation analysis in the conidial and mycelial stages of T. rubrum. A total of 157 propionylated sites on 115 proteins were identified, and the high confidence of propionylation identification was validated by parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) assay. The results show that the propionylated proteins were mostly involved in various metabolic pathways. Histones and 15 pathogenicity-related proteins were also targets for propionylation modification, suggesting their roles in epigenetic regulation and pathogenicity. A comparison of the conidial and mycelial stages revealed that most propionylated proteins and sites were growth-stage specific and independent of protein abundance. Based on the function classifications, the propionylated proteins had a similar distribution in both stages; however, some differences were also identified. Furthermore, our results show that the concentration of propionyl-CoA had a significant influence on the propionylation level. In addition to the acetylation, succinylation and propionylation identified in T. rubrum, 26 other PTMs were also found to exist in this fungus. Overall, our study provides the first global propionylation profile of a pathogenic fungus. These results would be a foundation for further research on the regulation mechanism of propionylation in T. rubrum, which will enhance our understanding of the physiological features of T. rubrum and provide some clues for the exploration of improved therapies to treat this medically important fungus.",

The practice of psychological and pedagogical support for children raised in guardianship families shows the need for psychological and legal assistance. The aim is to develop proposals for the organization of a legal and regulatory framework in accordance with the social and psychological needs of guardianship families and to identify the possibilities of the Ombudsman for the Rights of the Child to protect the rights of minors raised in guardianship families. The article identifies the current problems of guardianship families and considers the existing legal framework for the protection of the rights of minors raised in families with a related form of guardianship. One of the main problems of psychological and pedagogical support for children raised in families with a related form of guardianship is the absence of a coordinating center for the organization of cooperation between educational organizations, guardianship bodies, centers for psychological, pedagogical, medical, and social assistance. The Ombudsman for the Rights of the Child may be the focal point. It is also proposed to establish, based on the offices of the Ombudsmen for the Rights of the Child, centers for the support of guardianship families in the constituent entities of the Russian Federation, to which both guardians and children can apply. These measures are aimed at preventing secondary orphans.",

His rights are not of absolute nature.His  rights are governed by the concept that he is the trustee who is accountable to Allah for all his deeds. As a trustee, he does not have unlimited authority, according to Shri'ah to exercise his own rights in any manner whatsoever or to abuse his rights; he has to rather follow the guidelines and instructions given by the Absolute Owner & the Source of all rights, the Almighty Allah.

We worked with 25 creative young adults at relative socioeconomic, educational and\/or health disadvantage in 2016 and 2017. Facilitated by the project leads, the emerging young talents connected with science in a series of culturally- and personally-relevant and creative sessions, culminating in their production of digital content and a one-hour live radio show, which reached at least 2324 people online. As a result of taking part in The AudioLab, the young adults felt more confident about themselves and about science; they could see a role for their creative talents in science communication, and felt able to become actively involved in health research. After the project, the ongoing partnership between the project leads and the young adults helped 12 of the participants to progress to employment, training and voluntary roles within health, research, creative and communications environments. We believe that the AudioLab presents a way of working that takes a step towards greater diversity and inclusion among both the audiences and producers of public involvement in health research. It has the potential to be reproduced as a method in other locations. Abstract Background The AudioLab is an innovative way to support greater inclusion in public engagement and involvement in health research. A partnership between a public engagement with research specialist, and a director of a digital radio station working towards social change, The AudioLab piloted an approach working with young people at relative socioeconomic, educational and\/or health disadvantage to engage and involve them meaningfully, and sustainably, with health science and research. Methods Twenty-five young adults from diverse backgrounds took part in AudioLab pilots in 2016 and 2017. Facilitated by the project leads, they engaged with science in a series of culturally-relevant and creative sessions, culminating in their production of digital content and a one-hour live radio show, the latter reaching at least 2324 people online. Results Young adults\u2019 agency within health research and science engagement was increased, with 12 of the participants progressing to roles within health, research, creative and communications environments. Conclusions Through partnership working between the project leads, co-production of creative outputs by the young people with scientists and science communicators, and a \u2018reimagining\u2019 of the positive assets that diverse young adults bring to engagement with health research, the AudioLab presents a way of working that takes a step towards greater diversity and inclusion among both the audiences and producers of public involvement in health research. Further, the AudioLab has the potential to be reproduced as a method in other locations.",

On 2nd March 1961, the President of Paksitan issued and Ordinance, to give effect to certain recommendations of the Commission on Marriage and Family Laws which is called '' Muslim Family Laws Ordinance 1961. According to Muslim Family Law, it is essential that the  pronoucement of Talaq will be through the Arbitration Council . Arbitration for recomciliation cannot be avoided before the effectiveness of Talaq. The Ordinance considers three divorces at one time as one divorce. The Ordinance describes the term of Iddah as  ninty days and in the case of pregnant wife, the period of ninty days or that pregnancy whichever be latter, end. Woman can condition the marriage contract that she will have the right to pronounce divorce to be delegated to her by her husband . The Muslim scholars raised many objections regarding the pronouncement ot Talaq in the Law. The Muslims of Sub-continent struggled for Pakistan because they wnted to live according to their faith. So it is duty of the Government to enable the people to live according to the teachings of Islam. But the Muslim personal Laws in India are more Islamic.\r\n",

            "abstract": "This article deals with the predicament faced by an African woman in novel, The Secret Lives of Baba Segi\u2019s Wives. In this fascinating novel, Lola Shoneyin wrestles with several cultural pressures in marriage, which are also prevalent among black women in South African communities. The article grapples with dilemmas, challenges and unbearable pains of women who are often blamed for infertility in marriage, without a consideration of the fact that medical problems leading to infertility are non-discriminatory in nature. It argues that: (1) women\u2019s sexuality is viewed with a patriarchal prejudice; (2) the referral of infertile woman as worthless, which in essence reveals the quality of their inter-subjective relationship, depicts men as the agents and women as the objects in marriage; and (3) that the order of the African family unit is deeply constructed on gender lopsidedness. In the end, Masenya\u2019s notion of bosadi (womanhood) is employed to indicate the significance of the way in which a woman was created by God to be a fully active human.\n\nIntradisciplinary and\/or interdisciplinary implications: Even though this article is written from a practical theological point of view, its nature has implications for other disciplines in the area of social sciences. The article approaches the question of gender from multidisciplinary angles.",

El objetivo de este art\u00edculo fue analizar factores genot\u00edpicos y ambientales que influyen en los rasgos de crecimiento de una l\u00ednea nativa de cuyes del sur de la sierra ecuatoriana.\r\n\r\nM\u00e9todos: El trabajo se llev\u00f3 acabo en la granja experimental de Irquis de la Facultad de Ciencias Agropecuarias de la Universidad de Cuenca, con cobayos pertenecientes a dos subl\u00edneas nativas originarias de criadores rurales de las provincias de Azuay y Ca\u00f1ar. Los rasgos de pesos por edad y las ganancias en peso diario medidos en gramos fueron analizados mediante un modelo de an\u00e1lisis de varianza mixto con los efectos fijos; tama\u00f1o de la camada (5), \u00e9poca (semestral), sexo y n\u00famero de parto de la madre con el software R 3.4.4. Las subl\u00edneas Azuay (1) y Ca\u00f1ar (2) y los padres dentro de subl\u00edneas conformaron los efectos aleatorios. Se determinaron los estad\u00edgrafos b\u00e1sicos.\r\n\r\nResultados: Los pesos al nacer, al destete y a los 90 d\u00edas, medidos en gramos, fueron 110,2 \u00b1 1,81, respectivamente, y 117,0 \u00b1 1,44; 212,2 \u00b1 4,30 y 221,13 \u00b1 3,38; 540,7 \u00b1 12,01 y 659,1 \u00b1 9,44. Las heredabilidades para estos caracteres fueron 0,09 \u00b1 0,101; 0,34 \u00b1 0,201 y 0,11 \u00b1 0,111. Adem\u00e1s, se analizaron los pesos a los 30; 45; 60; 75 y 90 d\u00edas de nacidos y las ganancias entre todas las edades. Se determinaron los predictores BLUP para los padres de ambas subl\u00edneas. La variaci\u00f3n y las heredabilidades permiten aplicar selecci\u00f3n en el peso al destete y a los 90 d\u00edas.\r\n\r\nConclusiones: La l\u00ednea mostr\u00f3 niveles de crecimiento bajos, pero hay suficiente variaci\u00f3n y sus heredabilidades permitir\u00edan esperar progresos favorables en caso de realizarse un programa de selecci\u00f3n a mediano plazo.",

            "abstract": "By means of copper(I)-and ruthenium(II)-catalyzed click reactions of quinine- and quinidine-derived alkynes with azide-substituted chalcones a systematic series of novel cinchona-chalcone hybrid compounds, containing 1,4-disubstituted- and 1,5-disubstituted 1,2,3-triazole linkers, were synthesized and evaluated for their cytotoxic activity on four human malignant cell lines (PANC-1, COLO-205, A2058 and EBC-1). In most cases, the cyclization reactions were accompanied by the transition-metal-catalyzed epimerization of the C9-stereogenic centre in the cinchona fragment. The results of the in vitro assays disclosed that all the prepared hybrids exhibit marked cytotoxicity in concentrations of low micromolar range, while the C9-epimerized model comprising quinidine- and (<i>E<\/i>)-1-(4-(3-oxo-3-(3,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl)prop-1-en-1-yl)phenyl) fragments, connected by 1,5-disubstituted 1,2,3-triazole linker, and can be regarded as the most potent lead of which activity is probably associated with a limited conformational space allowing for the adoption of a relatively rigid well-defined conformation identified by DFT modelling. The mechanism of action of this hybrid along with that of a model with markedly decreased activity were approached by comparative cell-cycle analyses in PANC-1 cells. These studies disclosed that the hybrid of enhanced antiproliferative activity exerts significantly more extensive inhibitory effects in subG1, S and G2\/M phases than does the less cytotoxic counterpart.",

            "abstract": "The aim of this study was to evaluate the health status of children cured from hepatoblastoma. Forty-five patients with hepatoblastoma treated between 1996&#8722;2014 were assessed. The recorded data included sex, age at diagnosis, disease stage, treatment methods, time since diagnosis, and the evaluation of health status domains which included performance status, growth development, hearing, cardiovascular, skeletal, gastrointestinal, genitourinary, neurological, and hematological function. There were 30 boys and 15 girls. The age at diagnosis ranged from one month to 14 years (median one year). At the time of the health status evaluation, the youngest patient was 5.5 years old and the oldest was 21 years of age (median&#8212;10 years). All patients were treated according to the Childhood Liver Tumors Strategy Group&#8212;SIOPEL recommendations, though they were not active participants of the studies. The median cumulative dose of cisplatin was 520 mg\/m<sup>2<\/sup> and 360 mg\/m<sup>2<\/sup> for doxorubicin. Thirty-six patients underwent partial hepatectomy, and nine total hepatectomy and liver transplantation. At a median of nine years from diagnosis, 68% of hepatoblastoma survivors had experienced at least one chronic health condition of any grade. The most frequent late complication was ototoxicity (28.8%), and the most serious were second malignancies (6.6%) and cardiomyopathy (4.4%). Conclusion: Survivors of hepatoblastoma are at risk for long-term complications. They require long-term monitoring for late effects.",

            "abstract": "Here, we present a small Iranian family, where the index patient received a diagnosis of restrictive cardiomyopathy (RCM) in combination with atrioventricular (AV) block. Genetic analysis revealed a novel homozygous missense mutation in the <i>DES<\/i> gene (c.364T &gt; C; p.Y122H), which is absent in human population databases. The mutation is localized in the highly conserved coil-1 desmin subdomain. In silico, prediction tools indicate a deleterious effect of the desmin (<i>DES<\/i>) mutation p.Y122H. Consequently, we generated an expression plasmid encoding the mutant and wildtype desmin formed, and analyzed the filament formation in vitro in cardiomyocytes derived from induced pluripotent stem cells and HT-1080 cells. Confocal microscopy revealed a severe filament assembly defect of mutant desmin supporting the pathogenicity of the <i>DES<\/i> mutation, p.Y122H, whereas the wildtype desmin formed regular intermediate filaments. According to the guidelines of the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics, we classified this mutation, therefore, as a novel pathogenic mutation. Our report could point to a recessive inheritance of the <i>DES<\/i> mutation, p.Y122H, which is important for the genetic counseling of similar families with restrictive cardiomyopathy caused by <i>DES<\/i> mutations.",

            "abstract": "The effects of the emissions of anthropogenic greenhouse gases (GHGs), aerosols, and natural forcing on the summer-mean surface air temperature (TAS) in the East Asia (EA) land surface in the 20th century are analyzed using six-member coupled model inter-comparison project 5 (CMIP5) general circulation model (GCM) ensembles from five single-forcing simulations. The simulation with the observed GHG concentrations and aerosol emissions reproduces well the land-mean EA TAS trend characterized by warming periods in the early (1911&#8722;1940; P1) and late (1971&#8722;2000; P3) 20th century separated by a cooling period (1941&#8722;1970; P2). The warming in P1 is mainly due to the natural variability related to GHG increases and the long-term recovery from volcanic activities in late-19th\/early-20th century. The cooling in P2 occurs as the combined cooling by anthropogenic aerosols and increased volcanic eruptions in the 1960s exceeds the warming by the GHG increases and the nonlinear interaction term. In P3, the combined warming by GHGs and the interaction term exceeds the cooling by anthropogenic aerosols to result in the warming. The SW forcing is not driving the TAS increase in P1\/P3 as the shortwave (SW) forcing is heavily affected by the increased cloudiness and the longwave (LW) forcing dominates the SW forcing. The LW forcing to TAS cannot be separated from the LW response to TAS, preventing further analyses. The interaction among these forcing affects TAS via largely modifying the atmospheric water cycle, especially in P2 and P3. Key forcing terms on TAS such as the temperature advection related to large-scale circulation changes cannot be analyzed due to the lack of model data.",

            "abstract": "Owing to the harsh and unpredictable behavior of the sea channel, network protocols that combat the undesirable and challenging properties of the channel are of critical significance. Protocols addressing such challenges exist in literature. However, these protocols consume an excessive amount of energy due to redundant packets transmission or have computational complexity by being dependent on the geographical positions of nodes. To address these challenges, this article designs two protocols for underwater wireless sensor networks (UWSNs). The first protocol, depth and noise-aware routing (DNAR), incorporates the extent of link noise in combination with the depth of a node to decide the next information forwarding candidate. However, it sends data over a single link and is, therefore, vulnerable to the harshness of the channel. Therefore, routing in a cooperative fashion is added to it that makes another scheme called cooperative DNAR (Co-DNAR), which uses source-relay-destination triplets in information advancement. This reduces the probability of information corruption that would otherwise be sent over a single source-destination link. Simulations-backed results reveal the superior performance of the proposed schemes over some competitive schemes in consumed energy, packet advancement to destination, and network stability.",

            "abstract": "Overweight and obesity are important risk factors for type 2 diabetes (T2D). Moving towards healthier diets, namely, diets rich in bioactive compounds, could decrease the odds of suffering T2D. However, those individuals with high body mass index (BMI) may have altered absorption or metabolism of some nutrients and dietary components, including polyphenols. Therefore, we aimed to assess whether high intakes of some classes of polyphenols are associated with T2D in a population with metabolic syndrome and how these associations depend on BMI and sex. This baseline cross-sectional analysis includes 6633 participants from the PREDIMED-Plus trial. Polyphenol intakes were calculated from food frequency questionnaires (FFQ). Cox regression models with constant time at risk and robust variance estimators were used to estimate the prevalence ratios (PRs) for polyphenol intake and T2D prevalence using the lowest quartile as the reference group. Analyses were stratified by sex and BMI groups (overweight and obese) to evaluate potential effect modification. Catechins, proanthocyanidins, hydroxybenzoic acids, and lignans were inversely associated with T2D. Hydroxycinnamic acids were directly related in men. These associations were different depending on sex and BMI, that is, women and overweight obtained stronger inverse associations.",

Apple polyphenols (APPs), the major antioxidants in apples, possess wide-ranging beneficial biological functions. The present study aimed to investigate the effects of APPs on hepatic fat deposition and antioxidant capacity in finishing pigs, and their mechanisms. Results showed that APPs improved lipid profiles, increased antioxidant enzyme activities and reduced the fat deposition in the liver.

It has been established that alterations in cyclin-dependent kinase-like 5 (<i>CDKL5<\/i>) or forkhead box protein G1 (<i>FOXG1<\/i>) correspond to distinct neurodevelopmental disorders, given that a series of studies have indicated that RTT is also caused by alterations in either one of these genes. We investigated the evolution and molecular features of MeCP2, CDKL5, and FOXG1 and their binding partners using phylogenetic profiling to gain a better understanding of their similarities. We also predicted the structural order&#8722;disorder propensity and assessed the evolutionary rates per site of MeCP2, CDKL5, and FOXG1 to investigate the relationships between disordered structure and other related properties with RTT. Here, we provide insight to the structural characteristics, evolution and interaction landscapes of those three proteins. We also uncovered the disordered structure properties and evolution of those proteins which may provide valuable information for the development of therapeutic strategies of RTT.",

            "abstract": "In order to minimize re-discovery of already known anti-infective compounds, we focused our screening approach on understudied, almost untapped marine environments including marine invertebrates and their associated bacteria. Therefore, two sea cucumber species, <i>Holothuria leucospilota<\/i> and <i>Stichopus vastus<\/i>, were collected from Lampung (Indonesia), and 127 bacterial strains were identified by partial 16S rRNA-gene sequencing analysis and compared with the NCBI database. In addition, the overall bacterial diversity from tissue samples of the sea cucumbers <i>H. leucospilota<\/i> and <i>S. vastus<\/i> was analyzed using the cultivation-independent Illumina MiSEQ analysis. Selected bacterial isolates were grown to high densities and the extracted biomass was tested against a selection of bacteria and fungi as well as the hepatitis C virus (HCV). Identification of putative bioactive bacterial-derived compounds were performed by analyzing the accurate mass of the precursor\/parent ions (MS<sup>1<\/sup>) as well as product\/daughter ions (MS<sup>2<\/sup>) using high resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) analysis of all active fractions. With this attempt we were able to identify 23 putatively known and two previously unidentified precursor ions. Moreover, through 16S rRNA-gene sequencing we were able to identify putatively novel bacterial species from the phyla Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria and also Firmicutes. Our findings suggest that sea cucumbers like <i>H. leucospilota<\/i> and <i>S. vastus<\/i> are promising sources for the isolation of novel bacterial species that produce compounds with potentially high biotechnological potential.",

            "abstract": "The prediction of long term water balance components is not a trivial issue, even when empirical Budyko&#8217;s type approaches are used, because parameter estimation is often hampered by missing or poor hydrological data. In order to overcome this issue, we provided regression equations that link climate, morphological, and vegetation parameters to Fu&#8217;s parameter. Climate is here defined as a specific seasonal pattern of potential evapotranspiration and rain: five climatic scenarios have been considered to mimic different conditions worldwide. A weather generator has been used to create stochastic time series for the related climatic scenario, which in turn has been used as an input to a conceptual hydrological model to obtain long-term water balance components with low computational effort, while preserving fundamental process descriptions. The morphology and vegetation&#8217;s role in determining water partitioning process has been epitomized in four parameters of the conceptual model. Numerical simulations explored a large set of basins in the five climates. Results show that climate superimposes partitioning rules for a given basin; morphological and vegetation watershed properties, as conceptualized by model parameters, determine the Fu&#8217;s parameter within a given climate. A sensitive analysis confirmed that vegetation has the most influencing role in determining water partitioning rules, followed by soil permeability. Finally, linear regressions relating basin characteristics to Fu&#8217;s parameter have been obtained in the five climates and tested in a basin for each case, obtaining encouraging results. The small amount of data required and the very low computational effort of the method make this approach ideal for practitioners and hydrologists involved in annual runoff assessment.",

            "abstract": "The ecological momentary assessment (EMA) of eating behaviors represents an innovative, detailed and valid approach to capture the complexity of food intake and to overcome limitations of traditional dietary assessment methods. Moreover, EMA studies might generate a large variety of data (e.g., dietary, behavioral, physical, sociopsychological, and contextual information), thereby enabling to examine concurrent exposures and events. Due to the increasing number of studies in this field of research, here we systematically reviewed EMA methods for the assessment of dietary intake in epidemiological studies, and discussed implications and perspectives for future research. Our study summarized several protocols and platforms that may be applied to assess diet in terms of eating frequency, choices, and habits. Nearly 38% of studies used an event-contingent strategy by asking participants to report foods and beverages consumed in real-time at each eating occasion. Instead, approximately 55% of studies used a signal-contingent prompting approach that notified the participants to record their dietary consumption. The remaining studies used a combination of event- and signal-contingent protocols to compare their accuracy or to improve the assessment of dietary data. Although both approaches might improve the accuracy and ecological validity of dietary assessment&#8212;also reducing the burden for participants&#8212;some limitations should nevertheless be considered. Despite these limitations, our systematic review pointed out that EMA can be applied in various fields of nutritional epidemiology, from the identification of determinants of dietary habits in healthy people to the management of patients with eating or metabolic disorders. However, more efforts should be encouraged to improve the validity and the reliability of EMA and to provide further technological innovations for public health research and interventions.",

The bioaugmentation consortium consisted of four endophyte strains that showed plant growth-promoting traits (three <i>Pseudomonas<\/i> and one <i>Microbacterium<\/i>) plus three strains with the capacity to degrade organic compounds (<i>Burkholderia xenovorans<\/i> LB400, <i>Paenibacillus<\/i> sp. and <i>Lysinibacillus<\/i> sp.). The organically contaminated soil was supplemented with rhamnolipid biosurfactant and sodium dodecyl benzenesulfonate to increase the degradability of the sorbed contaminants. Soils were treated with organic amendments (composted horse manure vs. dried cow slurry) to promote plant growth and stimulate soil microbial activity. Apart from quantification of the expected decrease in contaminant concentrations (total petroleum hydrocarbons, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons), the effectiveness of our approach was assessed in terms of the recovery of soil health, as reflected by the values of different microbial indicators of soil health. Although the applied treatments did not achieve a significant decrease in contaminant concentrations, a significant improvement of soil health was observed in our amended soils (especially in soils amended with dried cow slurry), pointing out a not-so-uncommon situation in which remediation efforts fail from the point of view of the reduction in contaminant concentrations while succeeding to recover soil health.",

In this work, we developed a simple impregnation-reduction method for the synthesis of Ag-doped hierarchical ZIF-8 (Ag\/H-ZIF-8) nanocomposite. The nanocomposite was characterized by several techniques and its antibacterial activity was investigated. The Ag nanoparticles are uniformly dispersed in the porous ZIF-8 with narrow size distribution. Consequently, the resulting Ag\/H-ZIF-8 nanocomposite showed significantly enhanced antibacterial activities compared to the single ZIF-8 or Ag nanoparticles. Furthermore, the composite is biocompatible, because no obvious toxicity was observed on Hepatic epithelial cells. This study offers a new approach for the design of hybrid antimicrobial nanomaterials that have great potentials in practical disinfections.",

Previous studies on other respiratory viruses have shown that several host cytokines correlate with duration of hospitalisation, but this has yet to be investigated in children with RV-C infection. We determined the nasal cytokine profiles of these children and investigated their relationship with RV-C load and clinical outcome. Flocked nasal swabs were collected from children aged 24&#8722;72 months presenting to the Emergency Department at Princess Margaret Hospital with a clinical diagnosis of acute wheeze and an acute upper respiratory tract viral infection. RV-C load was determined by quantitative RT-PCR and cytokine profiles were characterised by a commercial human cytokine 34-plex panel. RV-C was the most commonly detected virus in pre-school-aged children hospitalised with an episodic wheeze. RV-C load did not significantly differ between asthmatic and non-asthmatic patients. Both groups showed a Th2-based cytokine profile. However, Th17 response cytokines IL-17 and IL-1&#946; were only elevated in RV-C-infected children with pre-existing asthma. Neither RV-C load nor any specific cytokines were associated illness severity in this study. Medically attended RV-C-induced wheeze is characterised by a Th2 inflammatory pattern, independent of viral load. Any therapeutic interventions should be aimed at modulating the host response following infection.",

Moreover, the factors that could impact the surface morphology and hierarchical porous structure were discussed. In the presence of Fe<sup>3+<\/sup>, catechol-Fe<sup>3+<\/sup> complexes were formed to achieve pH-responsive polymer shell, combining with thermal-sensitiveness of poly(N-isopropylacrylamide). Doxorubicin (DOX) was applied as a model drug and the behaviors of its loading\/release behaviors were investigated to prove the idea. The results exhibited a significant drug loading capacity of 8.6% and embed efficiency of 94.6% under 1 mg ml<sup>&#8722;1<\/sup> DOX\/PBS solution. In fact, the loading capacity of drug can be easily improved to as high as 28.0% by increasing the DOX concentration. The vitro cytotoxicity assay also indicated that the as-prepared nanoparticles have no significant cytotoxicity on RAW 264.7 cells. The in vitro experiment showed that the cumulative release of DOX was obviously dependent on the temperature and pH values. This pH\/temperature-sensitive hollow mesoporous silica nanosphere is expected to have potential applications in controlled drug release.",

            "abstract": "Lead ion in drinking water is one of the most dangerous metals. It affects several systems, such as the nervous, gastrointestinal, reproductive, renal, and cardiovascular systems. Adsorption process is used as a technology that can solve this problem through suitable composites. The adsorption of lead (Pb(II)) on graphene oxide (GO) and on two goethite (&#945;-FeOOH)\/reduced graphene oxide (rGO) composites (composite 1: 0.10 g GO: 22.22 g &#945;-FeOOH and composite 2: 0.10 g GO: 5.56 g &#945;-FeOOH), in aqueous medium, was studied. The GO was synthesized from a commercial pencil lead. Composites 1 and 2 were prepared from GO and ferrous sulfate. The GO and both composites were characterized by using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), Raman spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and dynamic light scattering (DLS). The adsorption capacity of Pb(II) on the GO and both composites was evaluated through adsorption isotherms. Composite 1 presented a significant agglomeration of &#945;-FeOOH nanorods on the reduced graphene oxide layers. Meanwhile, composite 2 exhibited a more uniform distribution of nanorods. The adsorption of Pb(II) on the three adsorbents fits the Langmuir isotherm, with an adsorption capacity of 277.78 mg\/g for composite 2200 mg\/g for GO and 138.89 mg\/g for composite 1. Composite 2 emerged as a highly efficient alternative to purify water contaminated with Pb(II).",

            "abstract": "The use of some very well-known chemotherapeutic agents, such as cisplatin, is limited by toxicity in normal tissues and the development of drug resistance. In order to address drug resistance and the side-effects of anti-cancer agents, recent research has focused on finding novel combinations of anti-cancer agents with non-overlapping mechanisms of action. The cytotoxic effect of the synthetic 5-aminopyrazole derivative <i>N<\/i>-[[3-(4-bromophenyl)-1<i>H<\/i>-pyrazol-5-yl]-carbamothioyl]-4-chloro-benzamide (BC-7) was evaluated by the bis-Benzamide H 33342 trihydrochloride\/propidium iodide (Hoechst 33342\/PI) dual staining method against HeLa, MeWo, HepG2, Vero, and MRHF cell lines. Quantitative fluorescence image analysis was used for the elucidation of mechanism of action and synergism with cisplatin in HeLa cells. BC-7 displayed selective cytotoxicity towards HeLa cells (IC<sub>50<\/sub> 65.58 &#177; 8.40 &#956;M) and induced apoptosis in a mitochondrial- and caspase dependent manner. This was most likely preceded by cell cycle arrest in the early M phase and the onset of mitotic catastrophe. BC-7 increased the cytotoxic effect of cisplatin in a synergistic manner with combination index (CI) values less than 0.9 accompanied by highly favourable dose reduction indices. Therefore, the results obtained support the implication that BC-7 has potential anti-cancer properties and that combinations of BC-7 with cisplatin should be further investigated for potential clinical applications.",

Both infiltrating immune cells and replicating bacteria consume oxygen, contributing to the profound tissue hypoxia that characterises sites of infection. Hypoxia in turn has a dramatic effect on both neutrophil bactericidal function and the properties of <i>S. aureus<\/i>, including the production of virulence factors. Hypoxia thereby shapes the host&#8722;pathogen interaction and the progression of infection, for example promoting intracellular bacterial persistence, enabling local tissue destruction with the formation of an encaging abscess capsule, and facilitating the establishment and propagation of bacterial biofilms which block the access of host immune cells. Elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying host&#8722;pathogen interactions in the setting of hypoxia will enable better understanding of persistent and recalcitrant infections due to <i>S. aureus<\/i> and may uncover novel therapeutic targets and strategies.",

            "abstract": "The demand for a service includes generally two major components; quality elements and the reasonable and affordable price. Public transport can be considered as a special service, there is no direct market competition for the provider, but the use of private transport modes substitutes the usage of public vehicles. The dominating competitor, the usage of private cars, causes higher CO<sub>2<\/sub> emission and has a serious impact on the environment. Thus, it is important to analyze from market and sustainability point of view which are the preferences of the public for the improvement of the urban transport system. This paper aims to conduct this analysis by including quality criteria and transport fare criteria related to the current service of a city and by setting up and testing a generally applicable model for decision support. Since the acquisition of public preference was the primary objective, and the problem can be considered as decision making, the Analytic Hierarchy Process was selected as methodology. There are previous research results of applying this method on public transport, however, not in an integrated model, in which quality and cost considerations are pairwise compared. Thus, the conventional Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) technique was used and the well-proven requisites of consistency and sensitivity check were analyzed. The new model was tested in a case study: surveying the public transport demand in the capital of Jordan, Amman.",

The effect of ECAP on the microstructure and mechanical properties of rolled Mg-2Y-0.6Nd-0.6Zr alloy was investigated by optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, electron backscattered diffraction and a room temperature tensile test. The results show that the Mg-2Y-0.6Nd-0.6Zr alloy obtained high strength and poor plasticity after rolling. As the number of ECAP passes increased, the grain size of the alloy gradually reduced and the texture of the basal plane gradually weakened. The ultimate tensile strength of the alloy first increased and then decreased, the yield strength gradually decreased, and the plasticity continuously increased. After four passes of ECAP, the average grain size decreased from 11.2 &#181;m to 1.87 &#181;m, and the alloy obtained excellent comprehensive mechanical properties. Its strength was slightly reduced compared to the as-rolled alloy, but the plasticity was greatly increased.",

            "abstract": "Increasing evidence has demonstrated that increased expression of cyclin-dependent kinase regulatory subunit 1B (CKS1B) is associated with the pathogenesis of many human cancers, including colorectal cancer (CRC). However, the regulatory mechanisms underlying the expression of CKS1B in CRC are not completely understood. Here, we investigate the role played by microRNAs in the expression of CKS1B and carcinogenesis in CRC. Among the six microRNAs predicted to target CKS1B gene expression, only miR-1258 was revealed to downregulate CKS1B expression through binding to its 3\u2019-UTR region, as ectopic miR-1258 expression suppressed CKS1B expression and <i>vice versa<\/i>. In CRC, miR-1258 expression also decreased cell proliferation and migration <i>in vitro<\/i> and tumor growth <i>in vivo<\/i>, similar to cells with silenced CKS1B expression. Considering the highly increased levels of CKS1B and decreased expression of miR-1258 in tumors from CRC patients, these findings suggest that miR-1258 may play tumor-suppressive roles by targeting CKS1B expression in CRC. However, the therapeutic significance of these findings should be evaluated in clinical settings.",

            "abstract": "Falls have become a relevant public health issue due to their high prevalence and negative effects in elderly people. Wearable fall detector devices allow the implementation of continuous and ubiquitous monitoring systems. The effectiveness for analyzing temporal signals with low energy consumption is one of the most relevant characteristics of these devices. Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have demonstrated a great accuracy in some problems that require analyzing sequential inputs. However, getting appropriate response times in low power microcontrollers remains a difficult task due to their limited hardware resources. This work shows a feasibility study about using RNN-based deep learning models to detect both falls and falls&#8217; risks in real time using accelerometer signals. The effectiveness of four different architectures was analyzed using the SisFall dataset at different frequencies. The resulting models were integrated into two different embedded systems to analyze the execution times and changes in the model effectiveness. Finally, a study of power consumption was carried out. A sensitivity of 88.2% and a specificity of 96.4% was obtained. The simplest models reached inference times lower than 34 ms, which implies the capability to detect fall events in real-time with high energy efficiency. This suggests that RNN models provide an effective method that can be implemented in low power microcontrollers for the creation of autonomous wearable fall detection systems in real-time.",

            "abstract": "Surface coating modification on a polyethylene separator serves as a promising way to meet the high requirements of thermal dimensional stability and excellent electrolyte wettability for lithium ion batteries (LIBs). In this paper, we report a new type of surface modified separator by coating polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) organic particles on traditional microporous polyethylene (PE) separators. The PE separator coated by PVDF particles (PE-PVDF separator) has higher porosity (61.4%), better electrolyte wettability (the contact angle to water was 3.28&#176; &#177; 0.21&#176;) and superior ionic conductivity (1.53 mS\/cm) compared with the bare PE separator (51.2%, 111.3&#176; &#177; 0.12&#176;, 0.55 mS\/cm). On one hand, the PVDF organic polymer has excellent organic electrolyte compatibility. On the other hand, the PVDF particles contain sub-micro spheres, of which the separator can possess a large specific surface area to absorb additional electrolyte. As a result, LIBs assembled using the PE-PVDF separator showed better electrochemical performances. For example, the button cell using a PE-PVDF as the separator had a higher capacity retention rate (70.01% capacity retention after 200 cycles at 0.5 C) than the bare PE separator (62.5% capacity retention after 200 cycles at 0.5 C). Moreover, the rate capability of LIBs was greatly improved as well&#8212;especially at larger current densities such as 2 C and 5 C.",

            "abstract": "Under the dynamic competition situation, the innovation competition interaction between enterprises will take the form of mutual responding, while the formulation and implementation of responsive innovation strategy will be influenced by both shareholders and managers in the principal&#8722;agent relationship. In our research, we try to understand how the difference of governance logic between shareholders and managers affects innovation interaction strategy of enterprises. In order to achieve this research goal, this study takes all eligible listed companies (from 2007 to 2016) in China&#8217;s stock market as samples. The results show that the parent company shareholding has a negative impact on the subsidiary responsive innovation, while companies whose managers hold more shares select the relatively positive strategy responsive innovation. Moreover, the degree of separation between ownership and control rights and the external institutional environment can moderate the above relationship. Relevant conclusions can provide some reference value for the formulation of responsive innovation decision of listed companies and provide new insights for the design of parent&#8722;subsidiary corporate governance structure and the design of managerial equity incentive mechanism in the context of corporate group governance.",

            "abstract": "The emergence of building information modeling (BIM) methodology requires the training of professionals with both specific and transversal skills. In this paper, a project-based learning experience carried out in the context of a project management course at the University of Extremadura is analyzed. To that end, a questionnaire was designed and given to students who participated in the initiative. Results suggest that BIM can be considered a virtual learning environment, from which students value the competences developed. The emotional performance observed was quite flat. Similarly, students valued the usefulness of the initiative. Students expressed a desire for the methodological change of the university classes, and thought that BIM methodology could be useful for other courses. The results obtained show a line of work to be done to improve the training of students and university teaching.",

This study aimed to obtain high-purity DZ and prepare and characterize different types of solid dispersions (SDs) in order to enhance aqueous solubility and bioavailability. Excipients were investigated in order to manufacture different types of solid dispersions (SDs). Second-generation solid dispersions (SG), third-generation solid dispersions (TG), and second- and third-generation pH-modulated solid dispersions (SD and TG pHM-SD) were produced via spray drying. The SDs were characterized and tested for in vitro DZ release and oral bioavailability. SDs have shown increased aqueous solubility and in vitro release rate. Solid-state characterization showed that DZ was in an amorphous state in most of the formulations. The enhanced aqueous solubility of TG-pHM SD was reflected by an increase in oral bioavailability, which significantly increased the maximum plasma concentration approximately 20-fold and decreased the time to reach the maximum plasma concentration. The production of pHM SDs that contain DZ via spray drying is a simple and effective approach for oral drug delivery, which has the potential to greatly reduce the dose and enhance therapeutics effects.",

            "abstract": "Cases of tick-borne diseases, including spotted fever rickettsioses, borreliosis, babesiosis, anaplasmosis and ehrlichiosis, in the United States and territories have more than doubled from 2004 to 2016 and account for 77% of all vector-borne disease reports. In an effort to inform control efforts, the presence of tick-borne pathogens and their vectors was assessed in a recreational park in Walker County, Texas. Here we report data from questing ticks collected on three dates from June 2017 to June 2018. The majority of ticks collected were <i>Amblyomma americanum<\/i> (96.69%) followed by three additional tick species: <i>Dermacentor variabilis<\/i> (2.59%), <i>Ixodes scapularis<\/i> (0.52%), and <i>A. maculatum<\/i> (0.21%). Ticks were pooled and tested for molecular evidence of bacterial and viral pathogens, respectively. All of the 68 pools of <i>A. americanum<\/i> had molecular evidence of the spotted fever group rickettsia, <i>Rickettsia amblyommatis.<\/i> Additionally, six (8.82%) of the <i>A. americanum<\/i> pools contained sequences matching <i>Ehrlichia chaffeensis<\/i>, the pathogen responsible for human monocytotropic ehrlichiosis, and 11 (16.18%) for <i>E. ewingii<\/i>. Three of the <i>A. americanum<\/i> pools demonstrated evidence of <i>Borrelia lonestari<\/i>. The presence of etiologic agents of known human disease in this study merits the continued surveillance efforts of ticks and their pathogens in areas where they could pose risks to public health.",

            "abstract": "Abstract Background Sharing interim result measures by the Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) with non-DSMB members is an important issue that can affect trial integrity. Currently, it is unclear if there are demographic factors associated with sharing such information. This study\u2019s objective is to primarily explore the demographic factors associated with the DSMB sharing certain interim result measures and secondarily, explore demographic factors associated with the perceived usefulness in sharing certain interim result measures, with non-DSMB members. Methods We conducted an online survey of members of the Society of Clinical Trials (SCT) and International Society of Clinical Biostatistics (ISCB) in 2015 asking their professional views on the DSMB sharing interim trial results, specifically the interim control event rate (IControlER), interim combined even rate (ICombinedER), adaptive conditional power (ACP) and unconditional conditional power (UCP) with non-DSMB members. Binary logistic and multiple linear regressions were used to explore if demographic factors were associated with sharing a certain interim result measure and the perceived usefulness of sharing that interim result measure, respectively. Multiple imputation (MI) was used to evaluate the impact of missing data as a sensitivity analysis. Results Approximately 3136 (936 from SCT\u2009+\u2009~\u20092200 from ISCB) members were invited (response rate of 12%; [371\/3136]. Two main findings: (1) involvement in more than 15 private industry-sponsored trials was associated with not endorsing the sharing of the IControlER (odds ratio [OR]\u2009=\u20092.92; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.31, 6.52]; p\u2009=\u20090.012), and (2) involvement in more than 15 private industry-sponsored trials was associated positively with an increase in the perceived usefulness in sharing the ACP by 2.35 points (beta coefficient estimate\u2009=\u20092.35 [95% CI: 0.45, 4.05], p\u2009=\u20090.017. The findings were similar after sensitivity analyses. Conclusions An individual involved with more than 15 trials that had some form of private industry sponsorship is a demographic factor associated with NOT sharing the IControlER by the DSMB and an increased perceived usefulness in sharing the ACP at interim. Further studies are needed to evaluate for these demographic factors given the limitations of this study related to missing data. Due to some key limitations, regarding high non-response and missing data, we caution interpreting the results as definitive, but rather look at them as a first exploratory step to find potential associations for further evaluation.",

            "abstract": "In this paper, the <i>K<\/i>-user interference channel with secrecy constraints is considered with delayed channel state information at transmitters (CSIT). We propose a novel secure retrospective interference alignment scheme in which the transmitters carefully mix information symbols with artificial noises to ensure confidentiality. Achieving positive secure degrees of freedom (SDoF) is challenging due to the delayed nature of CSIT, and the distributed nature of the transmitters. Our scheme works over two phases: Phase one, in which each transmitter sends information symbols mixed with artificial noises, and repeats such transmission over multiple rounds. In the next phase, each transmitter uses the delayed CSIT of the previous phase and sends a function of the net interference and artificial noises (generated in previous phase), which is simultaneously useful for all receivers. These phases are designed to ensure the decodability of the desired messages while satisfying the secrecy constraints. We present our achievable scheme for three models, namely: (1) <i>K<\/i>-user interference channel with confidential messages (IC-CM), and we show that <inline-formula> <math display=\"inline\"> <semantics> <mrow> <mfrac> <mn>1<\/mn> <mn>2<\/mn> <\/mfrac> <mrow> <mo>(<\/mo> <msqrt> <mi>K<\/mi> <\/msqrt> <mo>-<\/mo> <mn>6<\/mn> <mo>)<\/mo> <\/mrow> <\/mrow> <\/semantics> <\/math> <\/inline-formula> SDoF is achievable; (2) <i>K<\/i>-user interference channel with an external eavesdropper (IC-EE); and 3) <i>K<\/i>-user IC with confidential messages and an external eavesdropper (IC-CM-EE). We show that for the <i>K<\/i>-user IC-EE, <inline-formula> <math display=\"inline\"> <semantics> <mrow> <mfrac> <mn>1<\/mn> <mn>2<\/mn> <\/mfrac> <mrow> <mo>(<\/mo> <msqrt> <mi>K<\/mi> <\/msqrt> <mo>-<\/mo> <mn>3<\/mn> <mo>)<\/mo> <\/mrow> <\/mrow> <\/semantics> <\/math> <\/inline-formula> SDoF is achievable, and for the <i>K<\/i>-user IC-CM-EE, <inline-formula> <math display=\"inline\"> <semantics> <mrow> <mfrac> <mn>1<\/mn> <mn>2<\/mn> <\/mfrac> <mrow> <mo>(<\/mo> <msqrt> <mi>K<\/mi> <\/msqrt> <mo>-<\/mo> <mn>6<\/mn> <mo>)<\/mo> <\/mrow> <\/mrow> <\/semantics> <\/math> <\/inline-formula> is achievable.

            "abstract": "The groundwater from shallow coastal aquifers in Nigeria has been reported to be under intense stress resulting from both natural and anthropogenic impacts ranging from saltwater intrusion, effluent-related contamination and pollution to oil spillage, gas flaring, municipal, industries and agriculture. Here we characterised the hydrostratigraphy and hydraulic characteristics of the shallow coastal aquifers of the Niger Delta basin and assessed the resilience of groundwater to both natural and anthropogenic impacts. Fifty-two borehole logs were analysed from which lithological sections were used to generate cross-sections along with four profiles. The system was more complex than previously reported: a unit of silty sand was observed in the western part of the basin that thins out leaving the eastern part of the basin as an unconfined aquifer underlain by multiple thin beds of the sand aquifer. A layered sand aquifer occurs in the northern parts of the basin, which holds freshwater in this area, and is interbedded by clay layers which serve as aquitards. The relatively higher hydraulic conductivity of the Benin Formation units compared to those of the Deltaic Formation leave it with weaker climate change resilience and more vulnerable to pollution and contamination. While groundwater remains the dominant source of fresh water in the northern part of the basin, a strategic approach is needed to access potable water from the southern part where contaminated surface water appears to directly interact with groundwater of the uppermost unconfined aquifer. Management of waste and effluent related to oil spillage, municipal, industries and agricultural in this area should be engineered to protect the groundwater resources of this aquifer.",

            "abstract": "Amisulpride (ASP), an anti-psychotic agent, is a pharmacologically equivalent to sulpiride (SP). Because SP demonstrates anti-ulcer and anti-colitic activities, ASP with an aniline moiety was azo-coupled to salicylic acid to generate 5-(aminoethanoylsulfamoyl)-<i>N<\/i>-[(1-ethylpyrrolidin-2-yl)methyl]-2-methoxybenzamide (ASP-azo-ASA), with the expectation that it would act as a colon-specific mutual prodrug against colitis. Following a 24 h incubation, approximately 80% of ASP-azo-ASA was cleaved to form ASP and 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) in the cecal contents, whereas it remained stable in the small intestinal contents. Oral gavage of ASP-azo-ASA (oral ASP-azo-ASA) delivered 5-ASA to the cecum to levels comparable with those observed for sulfasalazine (SSZ; clinical colon-specific prodrug of 5-ASA) and without detectable concentrations of ASP in the blood, indicating efficient colonic delivery. Oral ASP-azo-ASA ameliorated 2, 4-dinitrobenzenesulfonic acid hydrate (DNBS)-induced colitis in rats more effectively than oral SSZ. Additionally, oral ASP-azo-ASA lowered the levels of inflammatory mediators in the inflamed distal colon more effectively than oral SSZ. Combined treatment with 5-ASA and ASP via the rectal route more effectively reversed colonic damage and inflammation than treatment with 5-ASA or ASP alone, confirming the mutual anti-colitic actions of 5-ASA and ASP. In conclusion, ASP-azo-ASA is an orally active mutual prodrug against rat colitis with limited systemic absorption of ASP.",

Current pathological staging system is not sufficient to accurately predict prognostic outcomes. Thus, accurate prognostic model for patient survival and treatment decision is demanded. Using differentially expressed gene analysis between normal pancreas and PAC tissues, the cancer-specific genes were identified. A prognostic gene expression model was computed by LASSO regression analysis. The PAC-5 signature (LAMA3, E2F7, IFI44, SLC12A2, and LRIG1) that had significant prognostic value in the overall dataset was established, independently of the pathological stage. We provided evidence that the PAC-5 signature further refined the selection of the PAC patients who might benefit from postoperative therapies. SLC12A2 and LRIG1 interacted with the proteins that were implicated in resistance of EGFR kinase inhibitor. DNA methylation was significantly involved in the gene regulations of the PAC-5 signature. The PAC-5 signature provides new possibilities for improving the personalised therapeutic strategies. We suggest that the PAC-5 genes might be potential drug targets for PAC.",

This series of events has created a trend for cosmetic consumers to undermine brand confidence and to self-check the safety of commercial cosmetic formulations through mobile apps. The purpose of this study is to examine the influence of trust in domain specific information on the safety rating of cosmetic ingredients on the perceived value and the purchase intention of the cosmetics. The results of structural equation modeling showed that involvement of skin safety (ISS) had a positive effect on trust in domain specific information on safety (TDSI) and brand loyalty (BL). TDSI showed a positive effect on the perceived safety value (PFV) and the perceived social value (PSV), and BL had a positive effect on the PSV. ISS, TDSI, and PSV had a positive effect on the purchase intention (PI) of green-grade cosmetics (GGC). As hypothesized, BL had an adverse effect on PI of GGC. Given the results, utilizing the signal of the domain specific information may be recommended to new entrants to the cosmetic business or manufacturers with relatively weak brand power.",

High-frequency (1 GHz) vibrational loading was imposed on the elastoplastic deformation stage during the uniaxial tension of the MG conducted at 50 K. It was found that imposing vibrational loading scarcely reduces the average deformation resistance. On the contrary, it results in a notable residual hardening effect after the vibrational loading is removed, which differs significantly from the previously reported acoustic softening mechanisms. Vibrational loading can increase the fraction of STZed atoms and enhance the shear localization degree, which is beneficial to the shear deformation of MGs. Meanwhile, the influence of vibrational loading on the local microstructure of MG is negligible. A plausible explanation of these phenomena is given by considering the accelerated aging of MG stemming from the &#946; relaxation.",

            "abstract": "Virus host shifts occur frequently, but the whole range of host species and the actual transmission pathways are often poorly understood. Deformed wing virus (DWV), an RNA virus described from honeybees (Apis mellifera), has been shown to have a broad host range. Since ants are often scavenging on dead honeybees, foodborne transmission of these viruses may occur. However, the role of the ant <i>Myrmica rubra<\/i> as an alternative host is not known and foodborne transmission to ants has not been experimentally addressed yet. Here, we show with a 16-week feeding experiment that foodborne transmission enables DWV type-A and -B to infect <i>M. rubra <\/i>and that these ants may serve as a virus reservoir. However, the titers of both plus- and minus-sense viral RNA strands decreased over time. Since the ants were fed with highly virus-saturated honeybee pupae, this probably resulted in initial viral peaks, then approaching lower equilibrium titers in infected individuals later. Since DWV infections were also found in untreated field-collected <i>M. rubra <\/i>colonies, our results support the wide host range of DWV and further suggest foodborne transmission as a so far underestimated spread mechanism.",

Previous studies have demonstrated that genetic engineering can be applied to enhance drought tolerance via overexpression\/ectopic expression of <i>NAC<\/i> genes. In the present study, the dehydration- and drought-inducible <i>GmNAC109 <\/i>from <i>Glycine max <\/i>was ectopically expressed in <i>Arabidopsis <\/i>(<i>GmNAC109-<\/i>EX)<i> <\/i>plants<i> <\/i>to study its biological functions in mediating plant adaptation to water deficit conditions. Results revealed an improved drought tolerance in the transgenic plants, which displayed greater recovery rates by 20% to 54% than did the wild-type plants. In support of this finding, <i>GmNAC109<\/i>-EX plants exhibited lower water loss rates and decreased endogenous hydrogen peroxide production in leaf tissues under drought, as well as higher sensitivity to exogenous abscisic acid (ABA) treatment at germination and early seedling development stages. In addition, analyses of antioxidant enzymes indicated that <i>GmNAC109-<\/i>EX plants possessed stronger activities of superoxide dismutase and catalase under drought stress. These results together demonstrated that GmNAC109 acts as a positive transcriptional regulator in the ABA-signaling pathway, enabling plants to cope with adverse water deficit conditions.",

            "abstract": "The variation in habitat has a direct effect on the plants and as a consequence, changes their content of the bioactive constituents and biological activities. The present study aimed to explore the variation in the essential oils (EOs) and phenolics of <i>Heliotropium curassavicum<\/i> collected from the coastal and inland habitats. Additionally, we determined their antioxidant and allelopathic activity against the weed, <i>Chenopodium murale<\/i>. Fifty-six compounds were identified as overall from EOs, from which 25 components were identified from the coastal sample, and 52 from the inland one. Sesquiterpenes were the main class in both samples (81.67% and 79.28%), while mono (3.99% and 7.21%) and diterpenes (2.9% and 1.77%) represented minors, respectively. Hexahydrofarnesyl acetone, (-)-caryophyllene oxide, farnesyl acetone, humulene oxide, farnesyl acetone C, and nerolidol epoxy acetate were identified as major compounds. The HPLC analysis of MeOH extracts of the two samples showed that chlorogenic acid, rutin, and propyl gallate are major compounds in the coastal sample, while vanilin, quercetin, and 4&#8242;,7-dihydroxyisoflavone are majors in the inland one. The EOs showed considerable phytotoxicity against <i>C. murale<\/i> with IC<sub>50<\/sub> value of 2.66, 0.59, and 0.70 mg mL<sup>&#8722;1<\/sup> for germination, root, and shoot growth, respectively from the inland sample. While the coastal sample attained the IC<sub>50<\/sub> values of 1.58, 0.45, and 0.66 mg mL<sup>&#8722;1<\/sup>. MeOH extracts revealed stronger antioxidant activity compared to the EOs. Based on IC<sub>50<\/sub> values, the ascorbic acid revealed 3-fold of the antioxidant compared to the EO of the coastal sample and 4-fold regarding the inland sample. However, the ascorbic acid showed 3-fold of the antioxidant activity of the MeOH extracts of coastal and inland samples. Although <i>H. curassavicum<\/i> is considered as a noxious, invasive plant, the present study revealed that EO and MeOH extracts of the <i>H. curassavicum<\/i> could be considered as promising, eco-friendly, natural resources for antioxidants as well as weed control, particularly against the weed, <i>C. murale<\/i>.",

Taking selected parts of the first two \u201cruku\u2019s\u201d of surah al-baqara as a case study,  it traces  some  salient  instances of such deviation  in the  earliest  purported English rendering of the Qur\u2019an by Alexander Ross done  in the middle of the seventeenth century.  Besides  attempting  to make  readers wary of such misleading attempts,  it also  aims at  inculcating in them a sense of distinguishing the authentic works of genuinely qualified renderers from such  ill-motivated and ill-informed purported translations.\r\n",

The artistic interest of this pictorial group, besides the advanced state of degradation of a number of the paintings, together with the ruined circumstances of the building accommodating the collection, today in reconstruction, were the key reasons for this study. Thermo-hygrometric measurements were carried out. A multianalytical methodology incorporating micro-X-ray diffraction (&#181;-XRD), energy-dispersive X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy (EDXRF), scanning electron microscopy&#8722;energy dispersive spectroscopy (SEM&#8722;EDS), micro-Raman spectroscopy (&#181;-Raman), micro-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (&#181;-FTIR) has been followed for the study. These analyses were complemented by infrared photography (IRP) and reflectography (IRR), allowing the study of the underdrawing technique. The results of this study were compared with previous ones of the painter&#8217;s workshop and important distinctions and similarities were found within the materials and techniques used. This analysis methodology on materials contributes to safeguarding and the ensuing community awareness of this cultural heritage in danger.",

The method proposed here and integrated in a GIS environment combines the hydraulic depth and the flow height for each cross section. The local maxima values indicate a sudden increase in flow width where water spills across the floodplain. Such an approach has been implemented as a GIS tool in the QGIS software, and provides a resulting polygonal map of the bankfull limits. The algorithm was applied on several fluvial reaches in Umbria (central Italy). The source code is available as open source. Preliminary results are presented in Section 4, comparing remotely sensed bankfull limits to those obtained from fields surveys and, more recently, by operator&#8722;expert interpretation of aerial orthophotos.",

The phosphors were prepared via synthesis of nitric acid. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) studies show that the synthesized samples can be indexed to nearly single-phase cubic ZnB<sub>2<\/sub>O<sub>4<\/sub>. The TL characteristics following <sup>90<\/sup>Sr beta irradiation (40 mCi) were studied. TL intensity is found to depend on Tb concentration. The optimal concentration of the doped Tb<sup>3+<\/sup> is 0.03 mol in TL measurements. TL dose responses of the phosphors to beta doses of 0.143, 0.715, 1.43, 15, 30 and 60 Gy showed fairly linear behavior. The minimum detectable dose (MDD) value for ZnB<sub>2<\/sub>O<sub>4<\/sub>:0.04Tb<sup>3+<\/sup> was found to be 87 mGy. The kinetic parameters of the ZnB<sub>2<\/sub>O<sub>4<\/sub>:0.03Tb<sup>3+<\/sup> sample were estimated by the glow curve deconvolution, the initial rise, the curve fitting, and the peak shape methods. The results indicate that these phosphors are thought to be promising candidates as TL materials. The results provide valuable knowledge of the characteristics of Tb-doped ZnB<sub>2<\/sub>O<sub>4<\/sub> for use in dosimetry research.",

            "abstract": "The computer is an important medium that allows people to connect to the internet. However, people with disabilities are unable to use a computer mouse and thus cannot enjoy internet benefits. Nowadays, there are various types of assistive technologies for controlling a computer mouse, but they all have some operational inconveniences. In this paper, we propose an innovative blowing-controlled mouse assistive tool to replace the conventional hand-controlled mouse. Its main contribution is that it uses microphones to induce small signals through the principle of airflow vibration, and it then converts the received signal into the corresponding pulse width. The co-design of software programming enables various mouse functions to be implemented by the identification of the blowing pulse width of multiple microphones. The proposed tool is evaluated experimentally, and the experimental results show that the average identification rate of the proposed mouse is over 85%. Additionally, compared with the other mouse assistive tools, the proposed mouse has the benefits of low cost and humanized operation. Therefore, the proposed blowing control method can not only improve the life quality of people with disabilities but also overcome the disadvantages of existing assistive tools.",

            "abstract": "Plasmonic noble metal nanostructured films have a huge potential for the development of efficient, tunable, miniaturized optical sensors. Herein, we report on the fabrication and characterization of gold-coated nanopost arrays, their use as refractometric sensors, and their optimization through photonics simulations. Monolithic square nanopost arrays having different period and nanopost size are fabricated by nanoimprint lithography on polymer foils, and sputter-coated by gold films. The reflectivity of these gold nanopost-shell arrays present dips in the visible range, which are efficient for refractometric sensing. By finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulations we reproduce the experimental spectra, describe the electric fields distribution around the nanopost-shells, and then explain their good sensitivity, around 450 nm\/RIU. Furthermore, we determine by simulations the influence of several geometrical parameters, such as array period, nanopost width, gold film thickness, and nanopost side coverage on both reflectivity spectra and sensing capabilities. Fully coated nanoposts provide an extremely deep reflectivity minimum, approaching zero, which makes the relative reflectivity change extremely high, more than two orders of magnitude higher than for partially coated nanoposts. These results contribute to the understanding of the plasmonic properties of metal coated nanopost arrays, and to the development of efficient platforms for sensing and other surface plasmon based applications.",

            "abstract": "Increasing human demands for water, energy, food and materials, are expected to accentuate resource supply challenges over the coming decades. Experience suggests that long-term strategies for a single sector could yield both trade-offs and synergies for other sectors. Thus, long-term transition pathways for linked resource systems should be informed using nexus approaches. Global integrated assessment models can represent the synergies and trade-offs inherent in the exploitation of water, energy and land (WEL) resources, including the impacts of international trade and climate policies. In this study, we review the current state-of-the-science in global integrated assessment modeling with an emphasis on how models have incorporated integrated WEL solutions. A large-scale assessment of the relevant literature was performed using online databases and structured keyword search queries. The results point to the following main opportunities for future research and model development: (1) improving the temporal and spatial resolution of economic models for the energy and water sectors; (2) balancing energy and land requirements across sectors; (3) integrated representation of the role of distribution infrastructure in alleviating resource challenges; (4) modeling of solution impacts on downstream environmental quality; (5) improved representation of the implementation challenges stemming from regional financial and institutional capacity; (6) enabling dynamic multi-sectoral vulnerability and adaptation needs assessment; and (7) the development of fully-coupled assessment frameworks based on consistent, scalable, and regionally-transferable platforms. Improved database management and computational power are needed to address many of these modeling challenges at a global-scale.",

            "abstract": "Herbivory and competition during the regeneration phase influence forest successional dynamics. We demonstrated the importance of using the Target Plant Concept to identify and overcome site limiting factors for subtropical maritime forest restoration associated with deer browsing and competition. <i>Quercus virginiana<\/i> Mill. (live oak) bareroot seedlings were planted into clearcuts along the US Southern Atlantic coast with different treatment combinations of herbivory control (fenced or non-fenced) against white-tailed deer (<i>Odocoileus virginianus<\/i> Zimm.) browsing and competing vegetation removal (none, one-year, or two-years). After three growing seasons, mean seedling survival was 61% with no significant treatment differences. Control of browse and vegetation interacted to facilitate growth of live oak; seedlings were significantly larger for all response parameters (diameter, height, crown width) when fenced and treated with vegetation control. Removal of vegetation improved seedling performance only in fenced plots, however, indicating a shift in pressure from herbivory to competition as the most limiting site factor when deer were excluded. After the second growing season, foliar nitrogen was greater in fenced plots than non-fenced plots and greater in two-year vegetation control subplots than non-vegetation control subplots. This result, however, was absent after the third growing season. Three years after clearcutting, there was no evidence of <i>Q. virginiana<\/i> natural regeneration in non-fenced plots. Even with artificial regeneration in non-fenced plots, <i>Q. virginiana<\/i> growth was slow, indicating that herbivory was a key limiting factor. Our findings illustrate the importance of accounting for site limiting factors and may aid in developing management prescriptions to promote semi-evergreen oak regeneration in ecosystems with high pressure from herbivory and competing vegetation.",

            "abstract": "ABO-incompatible liver transplantation (ABO-i LT) is associated with a higher risk of acute kidney injury (AKI) compared to ABO-compatible liver transplantation (ABO-c LT). We compared the risk of AKI associated with transfusion between ABO-c and ABO-i living donor liver transplantation (LDLT). In 885 cases of LDLT, we used a propensity score analysis to match patients who underwent ABO-c (<i>n<\/i> = 766) and ABO-i (<i>n<\/i> = 119) LDLT. Baseline medical status, laboratory findings, and surgical- and anesthesia-related parameters were used as contributors for propensity score matching. AKI was defined according to the &#8220;Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes&#8221; criteria. After 1:2 propensity score matching, a conditional logistic regression analysis was performed to evaluate the relationship between the intraoperative transfusion of packed red blood cells (pRBCs) and fresh frozen plasma (FFP) on the risk of AKI. The incidence of AKI was higher in ABO-i LT than in ABO-c LT before and after matching (after matching, 65.8% in ABO-i vs 39.7% in ABO-c, <i>p<\/i> &lt; 0.001). The incidence of AKI increased in direct proportion to the amount of transfusion, and this increase was more pronounced in ABO-i LT. The risk of pRBC transfusion for AKI was greater in ABO-i LT (multivariable adjusted odds ratio (OR) 1.32 per unit) than in ABO-c LT (OR 1.11 per unit). The risk of FFP transfusion was even greater in ABO-i LT (OR 1.44 per unit) than in ABO-c LT (OR 1.07 per unit). In conclusion, the association between transfusion and risk of AKI was stronger in patients with ABO-i LT than with ABO-c LT. Interventions to reduce perioperative transfusions may attenuate the risk of AKI in patients with ABO-i LT.",

This paper uses the date of the Chinese Private Enterprise Survey (CPES) to empirically investigate the impact of Confucianism on corporate environmental investment and its internal mechanism. The results show that: (1) Confucianism plays a significant role in corporate environmental investment. (2) In the areas where environmental regulation is relatively weak, Confucianism has a more significant effect on promoting corporate environmental investment. (3) The positive influence of Confucianism on corporate environmental investment is more obvious in heavy polluting industries. This paper&#8217;s conclusions deepen the theoretical cognition of the economic consequences of Confucianism and enrich the relevant literature on the subject of Confucianism. At the same time, this paper also expands the understanding of the determinants of corporate environmental investment from the perspective of the informal institution.",

            "abstract": "Abstract Scavenger receptor class B type 1 (SR-B1) plays an essential role in high density lipoprotein (HDL) metabolism. SR-B1 deficient (SR-B1 KO) mice are prone to atherosclerosis and exhibit abnormally large, cholesterol-rich, dysfunctional HDL. In a recent issue of J Transl Med, Cao et al. described results of proteomics analyses of HDL isolated from wild-type (WT) and SR-B1 KO mice using precipitation of large lipoproteins with polyethylene glycol (PEG).\u00a0They report abnormalities in SR-B1 KO HDL protein components that correlate with HDL function. In this commentary, we describe and discuss the differences in the results published by Cao et al. and those obtained in a recent study from our laboratory using shotgun proteomics of HDL of SR-B1 KO mice isolated by ultracentrifugation. We propose that different HDL purification procedures used may account for the discrepancies observed. We show that SR-B1 KO HDL purification using either PEG or dextran sulfate precipitation results in enrichment of small HDL subclasses, and may therefore underestimate alterations in lipoprotein composition or function. Compared to HDL obtained by ultracentrifugation, HDL isolated by PEG precipitation show a lower ApoE\/ApoA-I proportion and reduced cholesterol content. HDL protein components described by Cao et al. or our laboratory are mostly inconsistent: only 33 HDL proteins were detected in both datasets, whereas a significant number of proteins were only identified by Cao et al. (n\u2009=\u200943) or Contreras-Duarte et al. (n\u2009=\u200926) datasets. The relative abundance of HDL-associated peptide\u00a0and\u00a0protein levels in WT vs SR-B1 HDL were also highly different in both datasets. This study indicates that caution must be taken when interpreting results from HDL isolated by chemical precipitation.",

            "abstract": "The blockade of the programmed cell death protein 1\/programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-1\/PD-L1) pathway plays a critical role in cancer immunotherapy by reducing the immune escape. Five monoclonal antibodies that antagonized PD-1\/PD-L1 interaction have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and marketed as immunotherapy for cancer treatment. However, some weaknesses of antibodies, such as high cost, low stability, poor amenability for oral administration, and immunogenicity, should not be overlooked. To overcome these disadvantages, small-molecule inhibitors targeting PD-L1 were developed. In the present work, we applied in silico and in vitro approaches to develop short peptides targeting PD-1 as chemical probes for the inhibition of PD-1&#8722;PD-L1 interaction. We first predicted the potential binding pocket on PD-1\/PD-L1 protein&#8722;protein interface (PPI). Sequentially, we carried out virtual screening against our in-house peptide library to identify potential ligands. WANG-003, WANG-004, and WANG-005, three of our in-house peptides, were predicted to bind to PD-1 with promising docking scores. Next, we conducted molecular docking and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation for the further analysis of interactions between our peptides and PD-1. Finally, we evaluated the affinity between peptides and PD-1 by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) binding technology. The present study provides a new perspective for the development of PD-1 inhibitors that disrupt PD-1&#8722;PD-L1 interactions. These promising peptides have the potential to be utilized as a novel chemical probe for further studies, as well as providing a foundation for further designs of potent small-molecule inhibitors targeting PD-1.",

Traditional economic theories do not explain their characteristics and standard financial models fail to capture their statistic and econometric attributes such as their extreme variability and heteroskedasticity. Motivated by these findings, we study Bitcoin and Ether prices via a Non-Homogeneous P&#243;lya Gamma Hidden Markov (NHPG) model that has been shown to outperform its counterparts in conventional financial data. The NHPG algorithm has good in-sample performance and identifies both linear and non-linear effects of the predictors. Our results indicate that all price series are heteroskedastic with frequent changes between the two states of the underlying Markov process. In a somewhat unexpected result, the Bitcoin and Ether prices, although correlated, are significantly affected by different variables. We compare long term to short term Bitcoin data and find that significant covariates may change over time. Limitations of the current approach&#8212;as expressed by the large number of significant predictors and the poor out-of-sample predictions&#8212;back earlier findings that cryptocurrencies are unlike any other financial asset and hence, that their understanding requires novel tools and ideas.",

            "abstract": "Water is gradually becoming scarce in Afghanistan like in many other regions of the globe. The objective of this study was to evaluate the spatial changes in the availability and sustainability of water resources in Afghanistan. The Terrestrial Water Storage (TWS) data of the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite obtained from three different institutes, having 1&#176; &#215; 1&#176; spatial resolution for the period 2002&#8722;2016 was used for this purpose. Sen&#8217;s slope method was used to assess the rate of change, and the Modified Mann&#8722;Kendall test was used for the evaluation of the significance of trends in TWS. After, the concept of reliability&#8722;resiliency&#8722;vulnerability (RRV) was used for assessing the spatial distribution of sustainability in water resources. The results revealed a significant decrease in water availability in the country over the last 15 years. The decrease was found to be highest in the central region where most of the population of the country resides. The reliability in water resources was found high in the northeast Himalayan region and low in the southwest desert; resilience was found low in the central region, while vulnerability was found high in the south and the southeast. Overall, the water resources of the country were found most sustainable in the northeast and southwest and least in the south and the central parts. The maps of water resource sustainability and the changes in water availability produced in the present study can be used for long-term planning of water resources for adaptation to global changes. Besides, those can be used for the management of water resources in a sustainable and judicious manner.",

            "abstract": "Pearl millet (PM) is the fifth most important cereal crop in the world after rice, wheat, maize, and sorghum. To date no previous studies have evaluated the nutritional characteristics and health promoting activity of the Moroccan variety. In this focus, this study aims at characterizing Moroccan Pennisetum glaucum seeds for their chemical composition (fibers, oil, proteins, fatty acids, minerals and phenolics), and antioxidative and antibacterial properties of polar and apolar fractions. The Moroccan variety contains considerable amount of proteins (10.84\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.22%), Oil (6.45\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.12%), Calcium (Ca) (211.01\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.12\u00a0mg\/100\u00a0g) and Magnesium (Mg) (174.04\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.12\u00a0mg\/100\u00a0g). Manifestly, PM is a good source of lipids since the major fatty acids found in PM oil were oleic (38.39%) and linoleic (36.61%). Moreover, phenolic and flavonoid content of PM fractions varied from 4.19\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.21 to 22.78\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.42\u00a0mg GAE\/g fdw, and from 0.75\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.30 to 15.60\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.74\u00a0mg RE\/g fdw, respectively. Antioxidant evaluation resulted in higher activity for the ethanolic fraction (208.01\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.54\u00a0mg TE\/g fdw (DPPH)\/8.29\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.11\u00a0mg TE\/g fdw (TEAC)\/21.20\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.57\u00a0mg AAE\/g fdw (FRAP)). Furthermore, the antibacterial activities of the obtained fractions on gram negative and positive bacteria (Escherichia coli, Citrobacter freundii, Salmonella spp., Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus sp., Bacillus cereus and Listeria ivanovii) were evaluated using disk diffusion method. The results show that among all fractions, only the ethanolic fraction exhibited an antibiotic effect on all tested bacteria.

Modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA), a non-replicating poxvirus, has been used as a vaccine platform to safely deliver various antigens. A MVA-based YF vaccine (MVA-BN-YF) was tested with and without a non-mineral oil adjuvant in a hamster model of lethal YF disease and protective efficacy of this vaccine was compared with the 17D vaccine. The vaccine candidate MVA-BN-YF generated a protective response in hamsters infected with YFV that was comparable to protection by the live 17D vaccine. Similar levels of neutralizing antibody were observed in animals vaccinated with either vaccine alone or vaccine with adjuvant. Significant improvement in survival, weight change, and serum alanine aminotransferase levels were observed in vaccinated hamsters when administered 42 and 14\u2009days prior to challenge with Jimenez YF virus (YFV). Neutralizing antibodies induced by MVA-BN-YF were transferred to na\u00efve hamsters prior to virus challenge. Passive administration of neutralizing antibody 24\u2009h prior to virus infection resulted in significantly improved survival and weight change. A trend toward reduced liver enzyme levels was also observed. MVA-BN-YF, therefore, represents a safe alternative to vaccination with live-attenuated YFV.",

            "abstract": "Phragmites australis and Typha latifolia are two macrophytes commonly present in natural and artificial wetlands. Roots of these plants engage in interactions with a broad range of microorganisms, collectively referred to as the microbiota. The microbiota contributes to the natural process of phytodepuration, whereby pollutants are removed from contaminated water bodies through plants. The outermost layer of the root corpus, the rhizoplane, is a hot-spot for these interactions where microorganisms establish specialized aggregates designated biofilm. Earlier studies suggest that biofilm-forming members of the microbiota play a crucial role in the process of phytodepuration. However, the composition and recruitment cue of the Phragmites, and Typha microbiota remain poorly understood. We therefore decided to investigate the composition and functional capacities of the bacterial microbiota thriving at the P. australis and T. latifolia root\u2013soil interface. By using 16S rRNA gene Illumina MiSeq sequencing approach we demonstrated that, despite a different composition of the initial basin inoculum, the microbiota associated with the rhizosphere and rhizoplane of P. australis and T. latifolia tends to converge toward a common taxonomic composition dominated by members of the phyla Actinobacteria, Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, and Planctomycetes. This indicates the existence of a selecting process acting at the root\u2013soil interface of these aquatic plants reminiscent of the one observed for land plants. The magnitude of this selection process is maximum at the level of the rhizoplane, where we identified different bacteria enriched in and discriminating between rhizoplane and rhizosphere fractions in a species-dependent and -independent way. This led us to hypothesize that the structural diversification of the rhizoplane community underpins specific metabolic capabilities of the microbiota. We tested this hypothesis by complementing the sequencing survey with a biochemical approach and scanning electron microscopy demonstrating that rhizoplane-enriched bacteria have a bias for biofilm-forming members. Together, our data will be critical to facilitate the rational exploitation of plant\u2013microbiota interactions for phytodepuration.",

            "abstract": "Genomic selection (GS) is becoming increasingly applicable to crops as the genotyping costs continue to decrease, which makes it an attractive alternative to traditional selective breeding based on observed phenotypes. With genome-wide molecular markers, selection based on predictions from genotypes can be made in the absence of direct phenotyping. The reliability of predictions depends strongly on the number of individuals used for training the predictive algorithms, particularly in a highly genetically diverse organism such as potatoes; however, the relationship between the individuals also has an enormous impact on prediction accuracy. Here we have studied genomic prediction in three different panels of potato cultivars, varying in size, design, and phenotypic profile. We have developed genomic prediction models for two important agronomic traits of potato, dry matter content and chipping quality. We used genotyping-by-sequencing to genotype 1,146 individuals and generated genomic prediction models from 167,637 markers to calculate genomic estimated breeding values with genomic best linear unbiased prediction. Cross-validated prediction correlations of 0.75\u20130.83 and 0.39\u20130.79 were obtained for dry matter content and chipping quality, respectively, when combining the three populations. These prediction accuracies were similar to those obtained when predicting performance within each panel. In contrast, but not unexpectedly, predictions across populations were generally lower, 0.37\u20130.71 and 0.28\u20130.48 for dry matter content and chipping quality, respectively. These predictions are not limited by the number of markers included, since similar prediction accuracies could be obtained when using merely 7,800 markers (&lt;5%). Our results suggest that predictions across breeding populations in tetraploid potato are presently unreliable, but that individual prediction models within populations can be combined in an additive fashion to obtain high quality prediction models relevant for several breeding populations.",

The purpose of the paper was to analyze types of exercises, current and future behavior concerning PA, availability of sport and recreation facilities, and factors having the strongest relation with undertaking PA at a sufficient level according to pro-health recommendations of World Health Organization (WHO).   Patients and methods: A survey was carried out on the representative sample (n=2,000). Respondents were classified in accordance to their life stages with a two-step cluster analysis. Relationships between meeting the dose of PA required for health recommendations and a membership in groups of life stages were evaluated using log-linear analysis. The strength of this relationship was expressed by the odds ratio. In order to capture relationships between meeting WHO recommendations and a set of explanatory variables, a predictive model was built.   Results: Life stages and various related events have a significant relation with a decrease of PA. Among groups of a particular risk, there are professionally active and unemployed people aged 50&ndash;64 years without children as well as retirees aged 65+ years who do not meet WHO recommendations (45.3; 50.4% and 47.6%). The unemployed and retirees more frequently (p&lt;0.0001) do not or cannot practice sport and do not think that a change of their situation is expected soon. However, 35% of professionally active people aged 50&ndash;64 years without children and 18.2% of unemployed people declare that they are currently not active but if they had the possibility, they would start practicing sport.   Conclusion: Campaigns promoting PA should be targeted at groups of a particular risk. Any attempts of increasing PA or changing tendencies of its decrease should consider life conditions of these persons, as well as their needs, motivations, and barriers.  Keywords: physical activity, life stages, professionally active 50+ without children, unemployed 50+ without children, retirees without children, recommendations",

Razumovsky, Saratov, Russia; 2Institute Clinic of Gynecology, Obstetrics and Neonatology, Faculty of Medicine-University of Barcelona, Hospital Clinic-August Pi i Sunyer Biomedical Research Institute (IDIBAPS), Barcelona, Spain  Abstract: Vulvovaginal atrophy (VVA) is a silent epidemic that affects up to 50%&ndash;60% of postmenopausal women who are suffering in silence from this condition. Hormonal changes, especially hypoestrogenism inherent in menopause, are characterized by a variety of symptoms. More than half of menopausal women are concerned about the symptoms of VVA, such as dryness, burning, itching, vaginal discomfort, pain and burning when urinating, dyspareunia, and spotting during intercourse. All these manifestations significantly reduce the quality of life and cause discomfort in the sexual sphere. However, according to research, only 25% of patients with the symptoms of VVA receive adequate therapy. This is probably due to the lack of coverage of this problem in the society and the insufficiently active position of specialists in the field of women&rsquo;s health regarding the detection of symptoms of VVA. Many patients are embarrassed to discuss intimate complaints with a specialist, which makes it difficult to verify the diagnosis in 75% of cases, and some patients regard the symptoms of VVA as manifestations of the natural aging process and do not seek help. Modern medicine has in the arsenal various options for treating this pathological condition, including systemic and topical hormone replacement therapy, the use of selective estrogen receptor modulators, vaginal dehydroepiandrosterone, use of lubricants and moisturizers, as well as non-drug therapies. Timely diagnosis and adequately selected therapy for the main symptoms of VVA lead to restoration and maintenance of the vaginal function and vaginal health.

Age-related changes in muscle mass and body composition along with medical comorbidities including stroke, dementia, and depression place elderly adults at high risk for developing malnutrition and frailty. This loss of function and decline in muscle mass (ie, sarcopenia) can be associated with reduced mobility and ability to perform the task of daily living, placing the elderly at an increased risk for falls, fractures, and subsequent institutionalization, leading to a decline in the quality of life and increased mortality. There are a number of modifiable factors that can mitigate some of the muscle loss elderly experience especially when hospitalized. Due to this, it is paramount for providers to understand the pathophysiology behind malnutrition and sarcopenia, be able to assess risk factors for malnutrition, and provide appropriate nutrition support. The present review describes the pathophysiology of malnutrition, identifies contributing factors to this condition, discusses tools to assess nutritional status, and proposes key strategies for optimizing enteral nutrition therapy for the elderly.  Keywords: sarcopenia, home enteral nutrition, elderly, malnutrition, protein",

            "abstract": "In-ear devices, such as a hearing aids, electronic earplugs, and wearables, need electrical power to operate. Batteries are the current solution, but unfortunately they also create other problems. For example, several hundred million users, mostly elderly, must change their hearing aid batteries on a weekly basis, which represents not only significant financial costs but a negative environmental impact. A promising alternative involves harvesting energy by converting the dynamic jaw movements into electrical energy via the earcanal. The extent that jaw movements distort the earcanal is still unknown, making it difficult to design the appropriate energy harvesting system for the earplug. Moreover, the finite element methods are barely capable to model the behavior of the earcanal distortion because of the complexity of mechanisms that deform the earcanal. However, this paper presents an alternative method, based on analytical considerations, to understand in-ear mechanical quasi-static deformations using earcanal point clouds. This model quantifies the bending and compressive movements of the earcanal. It can therefore be used to select an appropriate deformation mode for harvesting energy from the earcanal\u2019s dynamic motion. The value of this approach was illustrated by calculating the obtainable mechanical energy from 12 human subjects. On average, the bending energy in a human earcanal was found to be three times greater than the radial compression energy. This key finding will need to be considered in the design of future in-ear energy harvesting devices. Such an energy harvesting device has the potential to revolutionize the market for in-ear wearable devices and hearing aids by complementing or replacing battery technology.",

This volume comprises six studies that examine the development of Swedish taxation from 1862 to 2013, and will likely be of great value in future Nordic tax research because of its comprehensiveness. The second review is about a book written in Swedish:Momsfri sjukv\u00e5rd (The VAT exemption for health care). This volume discusses a topical issue and presents convincing recommendations for changes in the Swedish VAT legislation. Finally, the Danish book International Skatteret, i et dansk perspektiv (International Tax Law, in a Danish perspective) is presented as highly recommended literature for students and practitioners in the field of international tax law. This volume discusses and illustrates general matters in international tax law, as well as specific matters relevant for Danish international tax law.",

Through impedance\n          spectroscopy analysis and modelling, it is shown that charge accumulation is decreased in\n          the HTL\/perovskite interface, between PEDOT:PSS to Cu:NiOx and CuO. This was indicative\n          from the decrease in double layer capacitance (Cdl) and interfacial charge accumulation\n          capacitance (Cel), resulting in an increase to recombination resistance (Rrec), thus\n          decreased charge recombination events between the three HTLs. Through AFM measurements, it\n          is also shown that the reduced recombination events (followed by the increase in Rrec) are\n          also a result of increased grain size between the three HTLs, thus reduction in the grain\n          boundary area.

Through impedance\n          spectroscopy analysis and modelling, it is shown that charge accumulation is decreased in\n          the HTL\/perovskite interface, between PEDOT:PSS to Cu:NiOx and CuO. This was indicative\n          from the decrease in double layer capacitance (Cdl) and interfacial charge accumulation\n          capacitance (Cel), resulting in an increase to recombination resistance (Rrec), thus\n          decreased charge recombination events between the three HTLs. Through AFM measurements, it\n          is also shown that the reduced recombination events (followed by the increase in Rrec) are\n          also a result of increased grain size between the three HTLs, thus reduction in the grain\n          boundary area. These charge accumulation properties of the three HTLs have resulted in an\n          increase to the power conversion efficiency between the PEDOT:PSS (8.44%), Cu:NiOx\n          (11.45%), and CuO (15.3%)-based devices.",

            "abstract": "Several approaches were explored to develop a high throughput procedure for relative determination of 14 different carbon-centered free radicals, both acyl and alkylaminocarbonyl type, in cigarette smoke. Two trapping procedures using 3-cyano-2,2,5,5-tetramethyl-1-pyrrolidinyloxy, or 3-cyanoproxyl radical (3-CNP) were designed for this study: a) trapping in solution and b) trapping on a solid support which was a Cambridge filter pad. Fresh whole smoke and vapor phase smoke from mainstream cigarette smoke from Kentucky Reference Cigarettes 2R4F, as partitioned via an unadulterated Cambridge filter pad, were transferred into each trapping system in separate experiments. The 3-CNP coated Cambridge filter pad approach was shown to be superior to the impinger procedure as described in this study. Gas chromatography coupled with mass selective detection (GC-MS) was employed for the first time as an alternate means of detecting several relatively highly concentrated radical adducts. Liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS\/MS) with precursor ion monitoring and selected ion monitoring (SIM) was used for detecting the large array of radicals, including several not previously reported: formyl, crotonyl, acrolein, aminocarbonyl, and anilinocarbonyl radicals. Relative quantitation was achieved using as external calibration standards of 4-(1-pyrrolidino)benzaldehyde and nicotine. It was determined that the yield of carbon-centered free radicals by reference cigarette 2R4F was approximately 265 nmoles\/cigarette at 35 mL puff\/60 sec interval\/2 sec duration smoking conditions.",

Materials and methods: A retrospective study was conducted on elderly patients from June 2008 to July 2017 in 2 teaching hospitals. The clinical and microbiological data, including antimicrobial susceptibility testing, string test, extended-spectrum &beta;-lactamase (ESBL) production, virulence gene, and multilocus sequence typing, of the hvKp group defined as aerobactin positive were compared with those of classic K. pneumoniae isolates. Results: A total of 45.7% of 202 K. pneumoniae isolates were hvKp.ST23, which were predominant in 2 hospitals, but they were not highly associated with hvKp in different hospitals. Hypermucoviscosity, K1, K2, magA, and rmpA\/A2 genes were highly related to hvKp (P=0.000). With regard to the host, invasive infections (P=0.000), liver abscess (P=0.000), abdominal infection (P=0.000), pneumonia (P=0.037), and septic shock (P=0.045) were significantly higher in the elderly with hvKp. In the hvKp group, patients with better nutritional status were associated with a more severe sequential organ failure assessment score and a more serious inflammation reaction. Patients with diabetes (odds ratio [OR]=2.566) are more likely to be infected with hvKp. Previous hvKp is associated with hypermucoviscosity (OR=15.249) are often paralleled with hvKp. Importantly, 26% of hvKp isolates produced ESBLs, and most of them showed a carbapenems-resistant (CR) phenotype. Multivariate analysis implied that patients with a history of surgery within the last 1 month (OR=15.999) is an independent risk factor for CR-hvKp infection. Conclusion: The prevalence of hvKP is high in the elderly. ESBL-hvKp, especially CR-hvKp, is emerging, which is a sign that clinical awareness and infection monitoring needs to improve.

Materials and methods: A retrospective study was conducted on elderly patients from June 2008 to July 2017 in 2 teaching hospitals. The clinical and microbiological data, including antimicrobial susceptibility testing, string test, extended-spectrum &beta;-lactamase (ESBL) production, virulence gene, and multilocus sequence typing, of the hvKp group defined as aerobactin positive were compared with those of classic K. pneumoniae isolates. Results: A total of 45.7% of 202 K. pneumoniae isolates were hvKp.ST23, which were predominant in 2 hospitals, but they were not highly associated with hvKp in different hospitals. Hypermucoviscosity, K1, K2, magA, and rmpA\/A2 genes were highly related to hvKp (P=0.000). With regard to the host, invasive infections (P=0.000), liver abscess (P=0.000), abdominal infection (P=0.000), pneumonia (P=0.037), and septic shock (P=0.045) were significantly higher in the elderly with hvKp. In the hvKp group, patients with better nutritional status were associated with a more severe sequential organ failure assessment score and a more serious inflammation reaction. Patients with diabetes (odds ratio [OR]=2.566) are more likely to be infected with hvKp. Previous hvKp is associated with hypermucoviscosity (OR=15.249) are often paralleled with hvKp. Importantly, 26% of hvKp isolates produced ESBLs, and most of them showed a carbapenems-resistant (CR) phenotype. Multivariate analysis implied that patients with a history of surgery within the last 1 month (OR=15.999) is an independent risk factor for CR-hvKp infection. Conclusion: The prevalence of hvKP is high in the elderly. ESBL-hvKp, especially CR-hvKp, is emerging, which is a sign that clinical awareness and infection monitoring needs to improve.
