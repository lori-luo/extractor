Although nonsurgical treatments such as pneumatic dilatation of the distal esophagus and botulinum toxin injections have been performed, these procedures have limited duration. Similarly, surgical treatment with Heller myotomy is associated with complications. At our institution, we perform the peroral endoscopic myotomy (POEM) in qualified patients. Briefly, POEM involves endoscopic creation of a mid-esophageal submucosal bleb, creation of a submucosal tunnel with the endoscope, and then a distal myotomy, resulting in relaxation of the distal esophagus. The aim of our study is to document perioperative pain and associated pain management for our initial patients undergoing POEM and to review the literature for perioperative complications of this procedure. Therefore, anesthetic and pain management for our initial eleven patients undergoing POEM were reviewed. Patient demographics, pre-POEM pain medication history, perioperative pain medication requirements, and post-POEM pain scores were examined. We found post-POEM pain was usually in the mild&ndash;moderate range; a combination of medications was effective (opioids, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, acetaminophen). Our literature search revealed a wide frequency range of complications such as pneumoperitoneum and subcutaneous emphysema, with rare serious events such as capnopericardium leading to cardiac arrest. In conclusion, our experience with POEM suggests pain and can be managed adequately with a combination of medications; the procedure appears to be safe and reasonable to perform in an outpatient endoscopy unit.

A total of 171 Croatian college students (118 females) completed questionnaires related to their parental attachment, parental involvement in academic functioning, and adjustment to college. Data were analyzed by hierarchical regression analysis. Results suggested that parental involvement in academic functioning in the second year is more related to the quality of attachment to parents than to the initial adjustment to college. While attachment was a significant predictor of only emotional adjustment, parental support in academic functioning predicted academic and social adjustment to college after three years of college. Results suggest that various factors related to parenting continue to play an important role in different aspects of students' adjustment to college.",

We performed this study using known published articles by the authors and literature found on Pub Med. We included 24 articles that analyzed specifically the results of clinical trial methods and\/or interpretation. This review found that studies have evaluated glaucoma specific aspects of glaucoma clinical trials including: Predicting the results of later phase clinical trials based on early phase clinical trials and animal studies; protocol design parameters such as intraocular pressure, inclusion criteria, method of pressure measurement, study population, and side effect evaluation; and study planning issues such as number of clinical sites as well as subjects, dropout rates, estimated serious adverse events, and protocol violations. This review suggests that the medical literature supports some aspects of glaucoma clinical trial study design. Additional design features might be derived from government regulations, guidance, as well as agency contacts, consultants, and clinical community standards. Study design decisions that must be made beyond the aforementioned resources should be made carefully, with appropriate consultation as needed, considering the risk\/benefit ratio to the study. However, more research is needed to better evaluate the design procedures and methods involved in glaucoma clinical trials to best provide a cost- and time-efficient study while achieving quality efficacy and safety results.",

            "abstract": "A 48-year-old woman sustained simultaneous isolated bilateral greater trochanteric fracture, following a road traffic accident. The patient presented to us 1 month after the injury. She presented with complaints of pain in the left hip and inability to walk. Roentgenograms revealed displaced comminuted bilateral greater trochanter fractures. The fracture of the left greater trochanter was reduced and fixed internally using the tension band wiring technique. The greater trochanter fracture on the right side was asymptomatic and was managed conservatively. The patient regained full range of motion and use of her hips after a postoperative follow-up of 6 months. Isolated fractures of the greater trochanter are unusual injuries. Because of their relative rarity and the unsettled controversy regarding their etiology and pathogenesis, several methods of treatment have been advocated. Furthermore, the reports of this particular type of injury are not plentiful and the average textbook coverage afforded to this entity is limited. In our study we discuss the mechanism of injury and the various treatment options available.",

            "abstract": "The study of Byzantine music began in Romania in the first decades of the XX century, mainly due to the studies of the priest Ioan D. Petrescu. A small group of researchers continued this work in the second half of the XX century, opening up important research directions, namely: identifying \u2013 in the country and abroad \u2013 the copied \/ drafted manuscripts by Romanians and local Byzantine music creators; establishing, on the basis of documents, the languages of worship of Romanians during the medieval period; fixing in time and space the appearance of Romanian singing and the age of the chromatic genre in Byzantine music, etc. After 1990 with the change of the political regime, a great deal was written about Byzantine music in Romania and new research themes were approached, including the evolution of church music in the XVIII century after the appearance of the first manuscript in Romanian, \u201dPsaltichia Rumaneasca\u201d by Filothei sin Agai Jipei; the contribution of Ghelasie Basarabianul to the promotion of church music in Romanian in the first half of the XIX century; the Romanian manuscripts from Mount Athos libraries, zonal contributions to the perpetuation of Byzantine music filon, the relationship between pre- and post-chrysanthonic Byzantine music, the revision of the\r\nmethod of portative transcription of songs in medieval notation.\r\nOur work attempts to synthesize these concerns by presenting the problematic spectrum of the investigations, the topics of the scientific manifestations, the categories of the publications in the field.",

            "abstract": "The objective of this study was to determine the demographic, clinical and survival characteristics and to identify risk factors for mortality due to tricuspid valve dysplasia in UK dogs. Records of client-owned dogs diagnosed with tricuspid valve dysplasia at a referral centre were retrospectively reviewed. Only dogs diagnosed with tricuspid valve dysplasia based on the presence of a right-sided heart murmur identified prior to one year of age, and confirmed with Doppler echocardiography, were included. Dogs with concomitant cardiac diseases, pulmonary hypertension and\/or trivial tricuspid regurgitation were excluded. Analysed data included signalment, reason for presentation, clinical signs, electrocardiographic and echocardiographic features, survival status and cause of death. Survival times and risk factors for mortality were evaluated using Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox regression. Eighteen dogs met inclusion criteria. Border collies were over-represented (p= 0.014). Dogs were most frequently referred for investigation of heart murmur. The most common arrhythmia was atrial fibrillation (n=3). Median survival time from diagnosis of tricuspid valve dysplasia was 2775 days (range 1-3696 days; 95% CI 1542.41-4007.59) and from onset of right-sided congestive heart failure was 181 days (range 1-2130 days; 95% CI 0-455.59). Syncope was the sole risk factor for cardiac death. In this population of UK dogs, tricuspid valve dysplasia was uncommon but, when severe, frequently led to right-sided congestive heart failure. Prognosis was favourable for mild and moderate tricuspid dysplasia. Survival time was reduced with right-sided congestive heart failure but varied widely. Risk of cardiac death was significantly increased if syncope had occurred.",

Methods  The following steps were taken: (1) implementation of the translation protocol and transcultural adaptation, (2) validation of the adapted content, and (3) assessment of reliability. To check intra- and inter-observer reproducibility, each patient underwent two interviews with interviewer-A and one with B. The QMGS was compared to the Myasthenia Gravis Composite Scale and Myasthenia-specific Quality of Life Questionnaire.  Results  Our study group consisted of 30 patients, with a mean age of 47.6\u00b111.4 years and a mean duration of illness of 11.33\u00b18.49 years. Correlation between the QMGS and MGC was very strong (r = 0.928; p < 0.001) and substantial between the QMGS and MG-QOL 15 (r = 0.737; p < 0.001).  Conclusion  The Brazilian Portuguese translation, and validation of the QMGS was successfully performed.",

Several case series have demonstrated the effectiveness of botulinum toxin injection for the management of focal lingual movement disorders. Only 1 case of botulinum toxin injection for primary lingual dystonia induced by speaking has been reported, but this treatment has limited effectiveness. Our patient was treated with botulinum toxin using a superficial approach for injection into the tongue with continuing excellent results. Lingual botulinum toxin injection is a fairly simple, safe and viable treatment option for lingual dystonia induced by speaking.",

The supplement comprises 500 mg elemental calcium and 500 IU of cholecalciferol. The dosing regimen comprised a loading dose of 1000 IU of cholecalciferol per day for one month (two tablets) and thereafter a maintenance dose of 500 IU of cholecalciferol per day for 2 months (one tablet).Outcome measure: Serum was collected for calcium, 25 hydroxyvitamin D3 (25OHD3), and PTH measurements, as well as early morning 2-hour urine calcium\/creatinine excretion index (Uca\/creat). Specimens were collected at baseline and after 3 months of therapy. Data are reported as mean &plusmn; 1 standard error and 95% confi dence intervals.Results: Data was available for the 21 subjects who completed the study. Two subjects (9%) withdrew because of gastrointestinal intolerance. There were 3 subjects with moderate (12.5&ndash;24 nmol\/L) and 18 with mild (25&ndash;49 nmol\/L) vitamin D deficiency. Ten subjects (48%) had secondary hyperparathyroidism. Following the oral Ca-D3 combination, serum 25OHD3 levels normalised in all subjects with 18 (86%) subjects achieving values of greater than 70 nmol\/L. Serum 25OHD3 levels increased from 36 (31&ndash;41) to 91 (79&ndash;102) nmol\/L (p = 0.0001), increasing by an average of 152% over the 3-month period. There was a corresponding 38% decrease in serum PTH concentrations at 3 months (5.1 + 0.6 pmol\/L), compared with baseline (8.0 + 1 pmol\/L) (p = 0.001). No subject developed hypercalcemia, but an elevated Uca\/creat excretion index occurred in one subjects.Conclusions: A combined oral Ca-D3 product (Osteoblast) is effective for treating vitamin D deficiency and is adequately tolerated.",

O experimento foi realizado em casa de vegeta\u00e7\u00e3o. O delineamento experimental foi inteiramente ao acaso, constitu\u00eddo por fatorial 6x3: tr\u00eas estirpes de bact\u00e9rias diazotr\u00f3ficas associativas (MTAz8, MTH2 e Y2), uma combina\u00e7\u00e3o das estirpes MTAz8 e MTH2, aduba\u00e7\u00e3o nitrogenada e testemunha absoluta, e tr\u00eas cortes (30, 60 e 90 dias), em cinco repeti\u00e7\u00f5es. A inocula\u00e7\u00e3o foi feita por meio da inser\u00e7\u00e3o de uma al\u00edquota de 5mL de caldo bacteriano contendo 108 c\u00e9lulas mL-1 no solo pr\u00f3ximo ao sistema radicular. As vari\u00e1veis avaliadas foram: massa seca da parte a\u00e9rea, porcentagem de prote\u00edna bruta, ac\u00famulo e concentra\u00e7\u00e3o de nitrog\u00eanio na parte a\u00e9rea e determina\u00e7\u00e3o do n\u00famero de bact\u00e9rias diazotr\u00f3ficas do solo. No tratamento adubado com nitrog\u00eanio, a produ\u00e7\u00e3o de massa seca aumentou ao longo dos cortes. Entre as estirpes de bact\u00e9rias associativas, a Y2 apresentou maior ac\u00famulo de nitrog\u00eanio e maior popula\u00e7\u00e3o de bact\u00e9rias no meio de cultura LGI. As caracter\u00edsticas nutricionais do capim-xara\u00e9s deca\u00edram \u00e0 medida que foram realizados os cortes.",

            "abstract": "Endothelins are endothelial peptides, the properties of which have been investigated for over 25 years. They play a special role in the pathophysiology of many diseases of the cardiovascular system. Endothelin-1, which is the most explored one, is a potent vasoconstrictor. It increases renal water and sodium excretion, augments cell growth and proliferation and has proinflammatory activity, by intensifying the production of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS and RNS). ET-1 takes part in the progression of such diseases as hypertension, atherosclerosis, heart and renal failure. The physio- and pathological effects of endothelins are mediated through ETA and ETB receptors. Blocking these receptors, in particular the ETA receptor, can prevent negative effects of endothelins. Long-term efforts to create drugs which act like that have brought relevant results. Endothelin receptor antago-nists (ERA) are a new class of medicines, which are indicated in the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension. There are also optimistic results of trials with ERA administered in other disorders. On the basis of these data we may conclude that there will be more indications for this group of drugs. This review discusses properties and new research directions of ERA registered in pharmacotherapy.\n\n",

Based on these fundamentals, Einstein published in 1917 a paper on the amplification of energy by Stimulated Emission of Radiation as part of his quantum theories. In 1955, Townes and Gordon turned Einstein&#39;s theories into practice, creating a coherent and amplified microwave device using ammonia gas in an optical medium. But it was at the beginning of the 1980s, that Anderson and Parrish published an article about the selective photothermolysis model which revolutionized clinical practice. The use of laser in photoaging began with CO2 (10,600 nm). In 1989, it was first used for resurfacing of a face with prominent photoaging. Ablative lasers have therefore had great popularity in the 1980s and 1990s, but prolonged postoperative time and significant risk of side effects have lowered the acceptance by patients. In 2004, the description of the fractionated radiation for the treatment of photoaging, by Mainstein, represented a great event. The stimulation of collagen occurred through fractional laser beams, which would reach the selected area while saving islands of sound skin. These islands accelerated the process of cicatrization of the treated tissue and shortened the postprocedure time. Furthermore, the fractionated radiation presented a smaller range of side effects, increasing the safety of the procedure. As mentioned earlier, as fractional lasers incise on the skin, they leave islands of healthy skin that accelerate recovery, while generating necrosis columns. Such necrosis columns remove damaged extracellular matrix material, allowing resettlement of fibroblasts. Such resettled fibroblasts, under the influence of a new tensile strength, restart to produce structures for extracellular matrix, such as collagen, elastin, and proteoglycans, in a more physiological way. Fractional lasers are considered by many dermatologists as the best choice in laser therapy for the treatment of photoaging.

            "abstract": "Objective: The objective of our study was to determine the feasibility of early extubation and to identify the risk factors for delayed extubation in pediatric patients operated for ventricular septal defect closure.  Methods: A prospective, observational study was carried out at our Institute. This study involved consecutive 135 patients undergoing ventricular septal defect closure. Patients were extubated if feasible within six hours after surgery. Based on duration of extubation, patients were divided two groups: Group 1= extubation time \u2264 6 hours, Group 2= extubation time >6 hours.  Results: A total of 99 patients were in Group 1 and 36 patients in Group 2. Duration of ventilation was 4.4\u00b10.9 hours in Group 1 and 25.9\u00b124.9 hours in Group 2 (P<0.001). Univariate analysis showed that young age, low weight, low partial pressure of oxygen, trisomy 21, multiple ventricular septal defect, high vasoactive inotropic score, transient heart block and low cardiac output syndrome were associated with delayed extubation. However, regression analysis revealed that only trisomy 21 (OR: 0.248; 95%CI: 0.176-0.701; P=0.001), low cardiac output syndrome (OR: 0.291; 95%CI: 0.267-0.979; P=0.001), multiple ventricular septal defect (OR: 0.243; 95%CI: 0.147-0.606; P=0.002) and vasoactive inotropic score (OR: 0.174 95%CI: 0.002-0.062; P=0.039) are strongest predictors for delayed extubation.  Conclusion: Trisomy 21, low cardiac output syndrome, multiple ventricular septal defect and high vasoactive inotropic score are significant risk factors for delay in extubation. Age, weight, pulmonary artery hypertension, size of ventricular septal defect, aortic cross-clamp and cardiopulmonary bypass time did not affect early extubation.",

Since, one of the most practical and useful solutions to decrease environmental pollutants is to deploy green purchasing and clean energies by organizations or even governments. Thus, the construction of renewable-energy power plants and, consequently, the green supplier selection for these plants\u2019 equipment has become more important. With this respect, this article presents a novel approach to assess and select green suppliers of a solar power plant. The proposed approach integrates Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process and VIKOR (Vise Kriterijumska Optimizacija I Kompromisno Resenje) methodologies. The results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed approach as a practical tool to assist managers and CEOs (Chief Executive Officers) of electric power industry in assessing suppliers of solar power plant\u2019s equipment.",

The first stage describes the current position of the business; the second stage describes the position of the business in the future and the last stage shows how the business will achieve these objectives. The focus of planning should be deciding on internal communication which form the basis for gaining the competitive advantage.

            "abstract": "Abstract Lexical access difficulties are frequent in normal aging and initial stages of dementia. Verbal fluency tests are valuable to detect cognitive decline, evidencing lexico-semantic and executive dysfunction.  Objectives: To establish which language tests can contribute in detecting dementia and to verify schooling influence on subject performance.  Method: 74 subjects: 33 controls, 17 Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) 0.5 and 24 (Brief Cognitive Battery - BCB e Boston Naming Test - BNT) 1 were compared in tests of semantic verbal fluency (animal and fruit), picture naming (BCB and BNT) and the language items of Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE).  Results: There were significant differences between the control group and both CDR 0.5 and CDR 1 in all tests. Cut-off scores were: 11 and 10 for animal fluency, 8 for fruit fluency (in both), 8 and 9 for BCB naming. The CDR 0.5 group performed better than the CDR 1 group only in animal fluency. Stepwise multiple regression revealed fruit fluency, animal fluency and BCB naming as the best discriminators between patients and controls (specificity: 93.8%; sensitivity: 91.3%). In controls, comparison between illiterates and literates evidenced schooling influence in all tests, except for fruit fluency and BCB naming. In patients with dementia, only fruit fluency was uninfluenced by schooling.  Conclusion: The combination of verbal fluency tests in two semantic categories along with a simple picture naming test is highly sensitive in detecting cognitive decline. Comparison between literate and illiterate subjects shows a lesser degree of influence of schooling on the selected tests, thus improving discrimination between low performance and incipient cognitive decline.",

            "abstract": "Polymorphism of Y-chromosome is an interdisciplinary science which aims to answer historical questions related to the peoples\u2019 ethnogenesis on the basis of population genetic research . Scientific research of Y-chromosome polymorphism began at the end of 1990s. Studies of Y-chromosome polymorphism represent only part of population genetic researches. In 2002 there was introduced a single standard regarding SNP-tree mutations and names haplogroups (consortium of Y-chromosome). Prior to this there was no less than 5 different classifications haplogroups. About this time, the National Genographic Project have been started, which purpose was to explore all the world populations by STR (short tandem repeats) and SNP (single nucleotide polymorphism) mutations of Y-chromosome. The basis is the principle of geographical residence. The results of research of the participants of this project resulted in hundreds of articles on the ethnogenesis of different nations of the earth published in journals specialized in population genetics, mainly in the English. In this article, the author presents his view on the methodological problems related to establishing of new application of historical science (the study of polymorphism of the Y-chromosome). The article contains descriptions and examples of faulty research and methodological mistakes. The author also addressed the issue of historiography of the study of the ethnogenesis of the Turkic peoples of Eurasia and methods of population genetics identifying the tools and methods for the study of Y-chromosome polymorphism. This article describes the methods of population genetics such as cluster analysis, phylogenetic networks, multidimensional scaling, calculation of \u201cgenetic\u201d distances, TMRCA.",

It was observed that \"Second Life\" was mostly preferred as the virtual learning environment. Literature review and quantitative research methods were mostly preferred in the studies respectively. Most of these studies used surveys to collect the data and sample size in most studies was between 31-100 participants. Mostly, participants were undergraduate students, and purposive and convenience sampling method were preferred in the studies. The data was mostly analyzed using quantitative descriptive analysis method. The most studied variable was academic achievement and the least one was the cognitive load. The studies yielded varying results owning to their study purposes and showed that virtual learning environments fostered student academic success, diminished the cognitive load by concretizing the concepts and ensured social and collaborative learning. The findings of this study might guide researchers aiming to employ virtual learning environments in their educational studies.",

            "abstract": "Abstract Verbal fluency tasks have been identified as important indicators of executive functioning impairment in patients with frontal lobe dysfunction. Although the usual evaluation of this ability considers phonologic and semantic criteria, there is some evidence that fluency of verbs would be more sensitive in disclosing frontostriatal physiopathology since frontal regions primarily mediate retrieval of verbs. Huntington's disease usually affects these circuitries. Objective: To compare three types of verbal fluency task in the assessment of frontal-striatal dysfunction in HD subjects. Methods: We studied 26 Huntington's disease subjects, divided into two subgroups: mild (11) and moderate (15) along with 26 normal volunteers matched for age, gender and schooling, for three types of verbal fluency: phonologic fluency (F-A-S), semantic fluency and fluency of verbs. Results: Huntington's disease subjects showed a significant reduction in the number of words correctly generated in the three tasks when compared to the normal group. Both controls and Huntington's disease subjects showed a similar pattern of decreasing task performance with the greatest number of words being generated by semantic elicitation followed by verbs and lastly phonologic criteria. We did not find greater production of verbs compared with F-A-S and semantic conditions. Moreover, the fluency of verbs distinguished only the moderate group from controls. Conclusion: Our results indicated that phonologic and semantic fluency can be used to evaluate executive functioning, proving more sensitive than verb fluency. However, it is important to point out that the diverse presentations of Huntington's disease means that an extended sample is necessary for more consistent analysis of this issue.",

We demonstrated with fluorescent probes DCFH-DA and TMRE that cisplatin at concentration 1 \u03bcg\/ml induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and decreased the value of mitochondrial membrane potential in both cell types. The combined treatment with cisplatin (1 \u03bcg\/ml) and fullerene C60 (7.2 \u03bcg\/ml) was shown to be followed by oppositely directed modulation of ROS production in thymocytes and L1210 cells. Cisplatin-induced ROS production was intensified in L1210 cells, while in thymocytes it was decreased. It is supposed that the different effects of combined treatment are associated with peculiarities of fullerene C60 accumulation and localization in normal and cancer cells.",

Character education has been the National Action Plan since May 2nd, 2010 by Muh. Nuh as Education Minister of Indonesia. The draft sets the year 2010-2014 as consolidation and the placement of the foundation. Then in 2015-2019 as a consolidation strategy implementation and continued in 2020-2024 as a sustainable development. There are many factors that cause the importance of Indonesian society to work together to succeed the character education in Indonesia. Schools have a strategic role in value education, the reality shows that schools cannot do it alone. Apparently, the family has a big enough role. Family is the first moral educator for children. Their parents were the first moral teachers and directly influential element. Whereas, teachers at school can change at any time. Parent-child relationships are built upon a very meaningful emotional foundation that allows a child to feel loved and valuable or unloved and worthless. If the individual character is based on religious values as the foundation\/main base, then will be born the soul of strong character and become strong nation shoots anyway. The main goal of character education according to Islam is to form the personality of learners so having ethics, and a good sense of culture and make it happen in everyday life.",

The new taxon differs from its congeners mainly in having: a poorly-developed pigmentation pattern, restricted to minute scattered blotches on dorsal region of head and body, but grouped in small, irregular blotches along the lateral body plate junction; four or five caudal vertebra, anterior to compound caudal centrum, with neural and haemal spines placed posteriorly, close to post-zygapophyses; and post-zygapophyses of the precaudal vertebrae without dorsal expansions connected with their respective neural spines. The new species shares with Aspidoras velites dorsolateral body plates not touching their counterparts dorsally, and infraorbital bones with reduced flanges that are restricted to the latero-sensory canal. Both of these are considered reductive character states, probably indicating a paedomorphic condition to both species.

On the basis of the selected actual material, displays of the grotesque elements in the semantic field of the work\u2019s text are traced. The grotesque world of the novel is the author's model of mankind, in which J. Swift presents his view not only on the state of the modern system of England, but also on the nature of man in general, reveals the peculiarities of the psychology of human nature, especially human socialization. In part II, the author continues to develop a complex and contradictory picture of human existence in front of the reader, the world of giants appears as an ambivalent system in which the features of an ideal society and ideal ruler, in author\u2019s opinion, with the ugly face of man and society, are marvelously combined.",

For its successful implementation as well as any other system, we must primarily measure the adoption and use of its factors. The purpose of this study was to systematically investigate published articles about the factors affecting the adoption of mobile health and categorizing the factors affecting the adoption of this system. Methods: This study is a comprehensive review done by searching major databases such as Google Scholar, Emerald, Science Direct, Iran Medex, SID, Magiran, Pub med, etc. In addition, we use Mobile, mobile Health + adoption, mobile Health + TAM, Health + TAM keywords in the range of 2004 to 2015. Results: Among the studies that use information technology theories to survey the factors affecting the adoption of mobile health, TAM model was used more than other models. Factors such as perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness and facilitating condition form TUATU are the most effective in the adoption of mobile health. Conclusion:  Results showed that by considering factors such as perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness and facilitating condition can increase the adoption of mobile health system. Consequently, these factors are recommended to be considered in planning to run systems. ",

This tumor arises from the Schwann cells responsible for the myelin sheath that helps keep peripheral nerves insulated. [1] Approximately, 3000 cases are diagnosed each year in the United States with a prevalence of about 1 in 100,000 worldwide. It comprises 5-10% of all intracranial neoplasms in adults. Incidence peaks in the fifth and sixth decades and both sexes are affected equally. Studies in Denmark published in 2004 show the incidence of 17.4\/million. Most acoustic neuromas are diagnosed in patients between the ages of 30 and 60, and men and women appear to be affected equally. [2] The case illustrated here is a rare one of acoustic\/vestibular schwannoma a surgical conditions, treated with Lycopodium, which produced improvement on both subjective and objective parameters.",

            "abstract": "Graphene on metal substrates often shows different electronic properties from isolated graphene because of graphene-substrate interactions. One needs to remove the metals with acids and then to transfer graphene to weakly interacting substrates to recover electrical properties inherent in graphene. This process is not easy and besides causes undesirable tears, defects, and impurities in graphene. Here, we report a method to recover the electronic structure of graphene from a strongly interacting Ni substrate by spontaneous Na intercalation. In order to characterize the intercalation process, the density-functional-theory calculations and angle-resolved photoemission-spectroscopy (ARPES) and scanning-tunneling-microscopy (STM) measurements are carried out. From the density-functional-theory calculations, Na atoms energetically prefer interface intercalation to surface adsorption for the graphene\/Ni(111) surface. Unlike most intercalants, Na atoms intercalate spontaneously at room temperature due to a tiny diffusion barrier, which is consistent with our temperature-dependent ARPES and core-level photoemission spectroscopy, and with our submonolayer ARPES and STM results at room temperature. As a result of the spontaneous intercalation, the electronic structure of graphene is almost recovered, as confirmed by the Dirac cone with a negligible band gap in ARPES and the sixfold symmetry in STM.",

This descriptive and cross-sectional study, was accomplished with 143 students (13.26 \u00b1 1.52 years), 40 boys and 103 girls. To detect the suspicious cases of scoliosis the test of Adam it was used: humped presence (suspects of scoliosis); humped absence. The verification of the adaptation of the weight of the school material (WSM) it was done starting from the relationship between PME and body mass (BM), being used the following classification: 10% of BM = adequate and; > 10% of BM = inadequate. The associations were verified by chi square. It was detected 71 (49.7%) suspicious cases of scoliosis, 40 men and 103 women. In both sexes, the frequency of suspicious cases was larger in the 13-15 year-old age group. Of the 143 students, most took weight of the material inside of the acceptable limit (91.61%). There were associations (statistically significant) between suspects of scoliosis WSM for 10-12 year-old boys and girls of 10-12 and 13-15 years. For this group of scholars, the prevalence of suspicious cases of scoliosis was larger in th women, in the older age group and in the individuals with school material with inadequate weight.",

            "abstract": "Background: The aim of this paper is to assess whether basic descriptive statistics is sufficient to interpret the data on physical activity of Poles within occupational domain of life. Material and Methods: The study group consisted of 964 randomly selected Polish working professionals. The long version of the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) was used. Descriptive statistics included characteristics of variables using: mean (M), median (Me), maximal and minimal values (max\u2013min.), standard deviation (SD) and percentile values. Statistical inference was based on the comparison of variables with the significance level of 0.05 (Kruskal-Wallis and Pearson\u2019s Chi2 tests). Results: Occupational physical activity (OPA) was declared by 46.4% of respondents (vigorous \u2013 23.5%, moderate \u2013 30.2%, walking \u2013 39.5%). The total OPA amounted to 2751.1 MET-min\/week (Metabolic Equivalent of Task) with very high standard deviation (SD) = 5302.8 and max = 35 511 MET-min\/week. It concerned different types of activities. Approximately 10% (90th percentile) overstated the average. However, there was no significant difference depended on the character of the profession, or the type of activity. The average time of sitting was 256 min\/day. As many as 39% of the respondents met the World Health Organization standards only due to OPA (42.5% of white-collar workers, 38% of administrative and technical employees and only 37.9% of physical workers). Conclusions: In the data analysis it is necessary to define quantiles to provide a fuller picture of the distributions of OPA in MET-min\/week. It is also crucial to update the guidelines for data processing and analysis of long version of IPAQ. It seems that 16 h of activity\/day is not a sufficient criterion for excluding the results from further analysis. Med Pr 2014;65(6):743\u2013753",

We explored this hypothesis by studying the relationship between diet and reproductive activity of Creagrutus guanes (Teleostei, Characidae). Our results showed that C. guanes had a generalist and omnivorous diet dominated by aquatic insects (mainly Diptera larvae) and seeds. Creagrutus guanes did not show intersexual or ontogenetic variation in diet. Peaks of feeding activity during rainy months were not synchronized with breeding in dry months. Our results do not support the hypothesis that the reproductive season has to be synchronized with high food consumption. We discussed the hypothesis fat reserves may be an important factor for the desynchronization of peaks of feeding and reproduction as explanation of seasonal breeding of this species.",

To this end, the purpose of this\r\nresearch is to examine the effects of teaching stress management skills on the\r\nquality of life of the nurses working at ICU of the hospitals affiliated to Shiraz\r\nUniversity of Medical Sciences.\r\nMethods: The subjects of the study consisted of 60 ICU nurses with the average\r\nstress score in Osipow job stress exam working at the hospitals affiliated to\r\nShiraz University of Medical Sciences. The subjects were randomly assigned\r\nto two groups (30 in the case and 30 in the control group). The intervention\r\nwas performed as a teaching stress management workshop for eight hours\r\nthroughout two-days (four hours per day), and the nurses were followed up\r\nfor two months. The data were collected through a two part questionnaire\r\nincluding demographic characteristics and WHO Quality of life BREF and\r\nwere analyzed in SPSS software using paired t test, and t-test.\r\nResults: The findings showed that the nurses of both the case and control\r\ngroups were homogeneous considering the demographic data such as age,\r\nsex, marital status, number of children, shift position, job satisfaction, number\r\nof working hours per week, work experience and the amount of income.\r\nMoreover, there was no significant difference between the mean score of the\r\nlife quality before the intervention in both groups. But after the intervention, a\r\nsignificant increase was revealed in the mean score of the life quality of the case\r\ngroup as compared to that of the control group (P<0.0001).\r\nConclusion: The findings revealed the efficacy of the stress management\r\nworkshop in improving the life quality of ICU nurses. During one and two\r\nmonths after the intervention, the mean score of the quality of life had a\r\nsignificance increase compared to the stage before the intervention",

            "abstract": "The term undifferentiated connective tissue diseases (UCTD) is used to identify systemic autoimmune diseases not fulfilling classificative criteria for defined connective tissue diseases (CTD). Aim of the present study was to evaluate the evolution to defined CTD of an historical cohort of 91 UCTD patients followed at our Unit and to describe clinical and serological characteristics of stable UCTD patients with a disease duration of more than 5 years. Patients, previously described, were selected for having an undifferentiated profile after 1 year of follow up. These patients have been regularly followed at our Unit and their diagnosis has been reassessed annually based on the existing classificative criteria. Seven UCTD patients with a follow up of less than 5 years have been excluded from the study, therefore 84 patients (F: 81, M: 3) have been analysed. During the follow up 28 patients (33%) developed a defined CTD. In particular 22 patients developed systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), while the remaining 6 patients developed other CTDs (2 primary Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s syndrome, 2 overlap syndromes, 1 Systemic Sclerosis, 1 rheumatoid arthritis). The evolution to a defined CTD occurred after a mean disease duration of 80.6\u00b1 66.8 months (min 14, max 336, median 72); the evolution to SLE occurred after a mean disease duration of 66.8\u00b143.3 months (min 17, max 216, median 57). Anti-cardiolipin antibodies were the only variable correlated with the evolution to SLE (p<0.05). Stable UCTD were characterized by a simplified clinical picture with no major organ involvement and by a simplified autoantibody profile (anti-Ro\/SSA antibodies and anti-RNP antibodies were the single antibody specificities observed in 22% and 13% of patients respectively). These results confirm previous data showing that about 30% of UCTD patients will develop a defined CTD, the predictive role of anti-cardiolipin antibodies for the evolution to SLE, and the existence of stable UCTD, distinct clinical entities with a simplified clinico-serological profile. The early identification of stable UCTD is very important both from a clinical and a research point of view. Future research is needed to define a new set of classification criteria.",

            "abstract": "Background: The natural hormone melatonin has sleep inducing properties. Insomnia in cancer patients is common. So far, melatonin has been seldom tried for the improvement of sleep in patients with malignancies. Keeping this in mind, we planned and conducted a double-blind study to test the efficacy of melatonin in promoting sleep in patients with malignancies suffering from insomnia.\n Objective: To assess the hypnotic efficacy of oral melatonin in cancer patients with insomnia.\n Materials and Methods: After Ethical Committee approval, 50 patients (age range 20-65 years) from our pain clinic \"NIVARANE\" who met the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 4 th edition criteria for primary insomnia were randomized to receive melatonin 3 mg or placebo at 7 pm orally every day for 14 days from our pharmacist. After 1, 7, 14 days, the patients were reviewed with the Athens insomnia scale oral questionnaire to document the subjective sleep quality. The patients and we, the investigators were blinded to the study drug.\n Results: There were 2 drop outs (one from each group) as they failed to complete visit on day 14. Significant differences in favor of melatonin treatment were found in clinically relevant improvements in insomnia (46.53%; P = 0.00001 vs. 11.30%; P = 0.1026) There was improvement in sleep from 1 to 7 days (19.91%; P = 0.00001 vs. 0.98%; P = 0.2563). More significant improvements were seen between 7 and 14 days (33.24%; P = 0.00001 vs. 10.42%; P = 0.1469).\n Conclusion: We conclude that daily intake of oral melatonin 2 h before bedtime improves sleep induction and quality in cancer patients with insomnia.",

Methods:  The sample consisted of 23 patients (11 men, 12 women; mean age of 15.76 \u00b1 1.75 years), Class II, Division 1 malocclusion, treated with the Herbst appliance. CBCT scans were obtained before treatment (T0) and after Herbst treatment (T1). Vertical alveolar bone level and alveolar bone thickness of mandibular incisors were assessed. Buccal (B), lingual (L) and total (T) bone thicknesses were assessed at crestal (1), midroot (2) and apical (3) levels of mandibular incisors. Student's t-test and Wilcoxon t-test were used to compare dependent samples in parametric and nonparametric cases, respectively. Pearson's and Spearman's rank correlation analyses were performed to determine the relationship of changes in alveolar bone thickness. Results were considered at a significance level of 5%.  Results: Mandibular incisors showed no statistical significance for vertical alveolar bone level. Alveolar bone thickness of mandibular incisors significantly reduced after treatment at B1, B2, B3, T1 and significantly increased at L2. The magnitude of the statistically significant changes was less than 0.2 mm. The changes in alveolar bone thickness showed no statistical significance with incisor inclination degree.  Conclusions:  CBCT scans showed an association between the Herbst appliance and alveolar bone loss on the buccal surface of mandibular incisors; however, without clinical significance.",

Without ignoring the specific policies concerning the openness degree, globalization might increase capital and technology flows towards these markets, thus generating a higher income rate growth than would be possible in a less integrated world economy. An important role in this capital stream is played by the investments made in emerging markets, process which continues to sustain a high interest from the behalf of equity funds (private or not) around the world. The paper analyzes the main aspects related to this kind of investments such as: ways to recognize an emerging market, arguments and counterarguments for these investments, new trends, capital flow related problems, the role played by the privatization and, finally, instructions for building an emergent market portfolio.",

In this research, we investigated the growth, biomass production and biochemical composition of Chlorella vulgaris using semi-continuous cultures employing three growth media (LC Oligo, Chu 10 and WC media). The highest cell density was obtained in LC Oligo, while the lowest in Chu medium. Chlorophyll a, carbohydrate and protein concentrations and yield were highest in Chu and LC Oligo media. Lipid class analysis showed that hydrocarbons (HC), sterol esthers (SE), free fatty acids (FFA), aliphatic alcohols (ALC), acetone mobile polar lipids (AMPL) and phospholipids (PL) concentrations and yields were highest in the Chu medium. Triglyceride (TAG) and sterol (ST) concentrations were highest in the LC Oligo medium. The results suggested that for cost effective cultivation, LC Oligo medium is the best choice among those studied, as it saved the cost of buying vitamins and EDTA associated with the other growth media, while at the same time resulted in the best growth performance and biomass production.",

There are basically two forms of presentation: geographic (dry or atrophic) and wet (neovascular or exudative). Geographic atrophy accounts for approximately 85%&ndash;90% of ophthalmic frames and leads to a progressive degeneration of the retinal pigment epithelium and the photoreceptors. Wet AMD causes the highest percentage of central vision loss secondary to disease. This neovascular form involves an angiogenic process in which newly formed choroidal vessels invade the macular area. Today, intravitreal anti-angiogenic drugs attempt to block the angiogenic events and represent a major advance in the treatment of wet AMD. Currently, combination therapy for wet AMD includes different forms of radiation delivery. Epimacular brachytherapy (EMBT) seems to be a useful approach to be associated with current anti-vascular endothelial growth factor agents, presenting an acceptable efficacy and safety profile. However, at the present stage of research, the results of the clinical trials carried out to date are insufficient to justify extending routine use of EMBT for the treatment of wet AMD.

O ensaio foi conduzido durante c\u00earca de dois anos em solo da s\u00e9rie Pinda, na Esta\u00e7\u00e3o Experimental do Departamento da Produ\u00e7\u00e3o Animal, munic\u00edpio de Pindamonhangaba. O calc\u00e1rio foi aplicado antes da aradura, antes da primeira gradagem, antes da segunda gradagem ou parceladamente, metade antes da aradura e metade antes da segunda gradagem. Em todos os tratamentos o corretivo mostrou efeito altamente significativo na redu\u00e7\u00e3o da acidez do solo. Nos primeiros meses, houve diferen\u00e7as sens\u00edveis entre os tratamentos. A aplica\u00e7\u00e3o parcelada apresentou rea\u00e7\u00e3o mais r\u00e1pida, diferenciando-se j\u00e1 no primeiro m\u00eas. No terceiro m\u00eas, observou-se igualdade de respostas entre os tratamentos que receberam calc\u00e1rio antes da aradura e parceladamente. \u00castes se mostraram superiores aos tratamentos que receberam calc\u00e1rio antes da primeira ou da segunda gradagem, que se comportaram igualmente. Entre o s\u00e9timo e o nono m\u00eas ap\u00f3s a aplica\u00e7\u00e3o, todos os tratamentos se igualaram.<br>The experiment as reported in this paper had the purpose to study the effects of the manners in which to apply clay to the soil in order to correct its acidity. During about two years this test has been continued in soils of the series Pinda, at the Experiment Station of the Departamento da Produ\u00e7\u00e3o Animal, in the Pindamonhangaba county. The clay was applied before plowing, before the first harrowing and before the second harrowing, or parcelled, that is, half before plowing and half before the second harrowing.",

We measured the level of VEGF in vitreous samples collected at the primary and following operations by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The vitreous levels of VEGF in 25 eyes of 22 patients with PDR were also studied as controls (PDR group).Results: The averaged VEGF level in the samples collected at the primary surgery was 1.98 &amp;plusmn; 2.23 ng\/mL in the PDR group, and it was 9.07, 1.94, and 8.07 ng\/mL in the AHFVP cases. After the primary surgery, the VEGF level rose up to 49.50, 15.60, and 50.60 ng\/mL at the subsequent surgeries for respective cases of the AHFVP group. These levels of VEGF were more than five times higher than the baseline at the primary surgery.Conclusion: The subsequent increase of the VEGF level after the primary surgery in eyes with an AHFVP suggests that the vitreous levels of VEGF are associated with the development of the AHFVP although only three eyes were studied.Keywords: VEGF, AHFVP, diabetic retinopathy ",

            "abstract": "Many coral reef fish exhibit habitat partitioning throughout their lifetimes. Such patterns are evident in the Caribbean where research has been predominantly conducted in the Eastern region. This work addressed the paucity of data regarding Honduran reef fish distribution in three habitat types (seagrass, mangroves, and coral reefs), by surveying fish on the islands of Utila and Cayos Cochinos off the coast of Honduras (part of the Mesoamerican barrier reef). During July 2nd - Aug 27th 2007 and June 22nd - Aug 17th, 2008, visual surveys (SCUBA and snorkel) were performed in belt transects in different areas: eleven coral reef, six seagrass beds, and six mangroves sites. Juvenile densities and total habitat surface area were used to calculate nursery value of seagrass and mangroves. A total of 113 fish species from 32 families were found during underwater surveys. Multi-dimensional analyses revealed distinct clusters of fish communities in each habitat type by separating fish associated with seagrass beds, mangroves, and coral reefs. Coral reefs showed the highest mean fish species richness and were dominated by adult fish, while juvenile fish characterized seagrass beds and mangrove sites. Habitat use differed widely at the fish species level. Scarus iseri (Striped Parrotfish), the most abundant fish in this study, were found in all three habitat types, while Lutjanus apodus (Schoolmaster Snapper) juveniles were located primarily in mangroves before migrating to coral reefs. Many species used seagrass beds and mangroves as nurseries; however, the nursery value could not be generalized at the family level. Furthermore, for some fish species, nursery value varied between islands and sites. Our results suggest that connectivity of seagrass, mangrove, and coral reef sites at a species and site levels, should be taken into consideration when implementing policy and conservation practices.

La motivaci\u00f3n para la realizaci\u00f3n de este trabajo fue la escasez de datos sobre la distribuci\u00f3n de peces de arrecife de Honduras en tres tipos de h\u00e1bitat (pastos marinos, manglares y arrecifes de coral), por lo que se realizaron censos de peces en las islas de Utila y Cayos Cochinos en la costa de Honduras (parte del Sistema Arrecifal Mesoamericano). Del 2 de Julio al 27 de agosto 2007 y del 22 de junio al 17 agosto 2008, se realizaron censos visuales (buceo y snorkel) en transectos de diferente \u00e1rea: 11 en arrecifes de coral, 6 en praderas de pastos marinos y 6 en manglares. La densidad de j\u00f3venes y el \u00e1rea total de la superficie del h\u00e1bitat se utilizaron para calcular el valor de la zona de crianza de pastos marinos y manglares. Un total de 113 especies de peces de 32 familias fueron encontrados durante los censos. An\u00e1lisis Multi-dimensionales revel\u00f3 distintos grupos de comunidades de peces en cada tipo de h\u00e1bitat por la separaci\u00f3n de los peces asociados a los lechos de pastos marinos, manglares y arrecifes de coral. Los arrecifes de coral presentaron el mayor promedio de riqueza de especies de peces y fueron dominados por peces adultos, mientras que los j\u00f3venes se caracterizaron por encontrarse en praderas de pastos marinos y zonas de manglares. El uso del h\u00e1bitat difiere ampliamente a nivel de especies de peces. Scarus iseri (loro rayado), el pez m\u00e1s abundante en este estudio, se encontr\u00f3 en los tres tipos de h\u00e1bitats, mientras que Lutjanus apodus, los j\u00f3venes, se encontraron principalmente en los manglares antes de emigrar a los arrecifes de coral. Muchas especies utilizan las praderas marinas y los manglares como criaderos, sin embargo, el valor de criadero no puede ser generalizado a nivel familiar. Adem\u00e1s, para algunas especies de peces, el valor de criadero vari\u00f3 entre las islas y los sitios. Nuestros resultados sugieren que la conectividad de los pastos marinos, manglares y arrecifes de coral a nivel de especies y sitios, debe ser tomado en cuenta para la aplicaci\u00f3n de pol\u00edticas y pr\u00e1cticas de conservaci\u00f3n.",

Del 2 de Julio al 27 de agosto 2007 y del 22 de junio al 17 agosto 2008, se realizaron censos visuales (buceo y snorkel) en transectos de diferente \u00e1rea: 11 en arrecifes de coral, 6 en praderas de pastos marinos y 6 en manglares. La densidad de j\u00f3venes y el \u00e1rea total de la superficie del h\u00e1bitat se utilizaron para calcular el valor de la zona de crianza de pastos marinos y manglares. Un total de 113 especies de peces de 32 familias fueron encontrados durante los censos. An\u00e1lisis Multi-dimensionales revel\u00f3 distintos grupos de comunidades de peces en cada tipo de h\u00e1bitat por la separaci\u00f3n de los peces asociados a los lechos de pastos marinos, manglares y arrecifes de coral. Los arrecifes de coral presentaron el mayor promedio de riqueza de especies de peces y fueron dominados por peces adultos, mientras que los j\u00f3venes se caracterizaron por encontrarse en praderas de pastos marinos y zonas de manglares. El uso del h\u00e1bitat difiere ampliamente a nivel de especies de peces. Scarus iseri (loro rayado), el pez m\u00e1s abundante en este estudio, se encontr\u00f3 en los tres tipos de h\u00e1bitats, mientras que Lutjanus apodus, los j\u00f3venes, se encontraron principalmente en los manglares antes de emigrar a los arrecifes de coral. Muchas especies utilizan las praderas marinas y los manglares como criaderos, sin embargo, el valor de criadero no puede ser generalizado a nivel familiar. Adem\u00e1s, para algunas especies de peces, el valor de criadero vari\u00f3 entre las islas y los sitios. Nuestros resultados sugieren que la conectividad de los pastos marinos, manglares y arrecifes de coral a nivel de especies y sitios, debe ser tomado en cuenta para la aplicaci\u00f3n de pol\u00edticas y pr\u00e1cticas de conservaci\u00f3n.",

            "abstract": "The Encantadas Complex is a unit composed of dioritic, tonalitic and trondhjemitic gneisses with minor hornblendite. This complex is intruded by granites of Neoproterozoic age. Major and trace element data indicate metaluminous to slightly peraluminous composition related to the medium-K calc-alkaline series. Compositional parameters are consistent with a common evolution from less differentiated magmas, probably through fractional crystallization. The orthogneisses show LaN\/YbN ratios from 10 to 50, K2O\/Na2O varying from 1.1 to 3.0, Y contents from 3 to 39 ppm, Yb from 0.3 to 3.7, and Lu with contents in the range 0.06 and 0.54 ppm. Such geochemical features are similar to those of Archaean tonalitic rocks and are usually described in rocks formed by partial melting of mafic rocks under high-pressure conditions leaving an eclogitic residue. The presence of diorites and hornblendites, associated to tonalitic and trondhjemitic gneisses suggests, on the other hand, that tonalitic magmas could be formed by hornblende-controlled fractionation of hydrous basaltic magmas. Tonalitic gneisses show U-PbSHRIMP zircon age of 2, 263 \u00b1 6 Ma for igneous crystallization and 2, 045 \u00b1 10 Ma for the metamorphism. The geochemical parameters, tectonic and geochronological features of Encantadas Complex are consistent with magmas derived from mantle metasomatized by subduction-related fluids in a continental-arc.<br>O Complexo Encantadas \u00e9 constitu\u00eddo por gnaisses tonal\u00edticos, trondhjem\u00edticos e dior\u00edticos com presen\u00e7a subordinada de hornblenditos.

A presen\u00e7a de dioritos e hornblenditos, associados aos gnaisses tonal\u00edticos e trondhjem\u00edticos sugere, por outro lado, que os mesmos podem representar rochas com uma evolu\u00e7\u00e3o comum, geradas provavelmente por fracionamento de hornblenda a partir de magmas b\u00e1sicos hidratados. Os tonalitos apresentam idade U-PbSHRIMP em zirc\u00e3o de 2,263\u00b16Ma para a cristaliza\u00e7\u00e3o e 2,045\u00b110Ma para o metamorfismo.

M\u00c9TODO: participaram desta pesquisa 24 indiv\u00edduos, sendo 12 com gagueira (GE1 e GE2) e 12 sem gagueira (GC). Foram coletadas amostras que teve como base um corpus de 10 frases chave que foram produzidas nas formas neutra, de d\u00favida e de certeza, totalizando 840 enunciados. A an\u00e1lise ac\u00fastica foi realizada por meio do programa Praat e os seguintes par\u00e2metros foram analisados: tempos e taxas de elocu\u00e7\u00e3o e articula\u00e7\u00e3o, ocorr\u00eancia e dura\u00e7\u00e3o de pausas e disflu\u00eancias, dura\u00e7\u00e3o das vogais t\u00f4nica e pr\u00e9-t\u00f4nica e ocorr\u00eancia da vogal p\u00f3s-t\u00f4nica. A an\u00e1lise estat\u00edstica foi realizada por meio dos testes Kruskall Wallis e qui-quadrado, com \u00edndice de signific\u00e2ncia de 95%. RESULTADOS: a express\u00e3o da d\u00favida apresenta taxa de articula\u00e7\u00e3o mais baixa no grupo controle, seguida da forma neutra e de certeza, com diferen\u00e7as estatisticamente significantes. Ainda no grupo controle, foi observado presen\u00e7a de pausas e disflu\u00eancias somente na express\u00e3o de d\u00favida. No grupo experimental, a maior diferen\u00e7a encontrada foi na dura\u00e7\u00e3o da vogal da s\u00edlaba t\u00f4nica. CONCLUS\u00c3O: de uma forma geral, o GC variou mais sua organiza\u00e7\u00e3o temporal a fim de expressar as atitudes. No entanto, \u00e9 poss\u00edvel observar tamb\u00e9m uma tend\u00eancia semelhante no grupo de pessoas com gagueira. Quanto \u00e0 velocidade de fala, ao retirar as pausas e as disflu\u00eancias, vemos que tanto GE1 quanto GE2 diferenciam a certeza, articulando cada s\u00edlaba de forma mais r\u00e1pida.",

This study was carried out with the purpose of assessing the protective effects of STW 5 in different doses on the hepatic histopathological damages induced by experimental cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) model in septic rats. Methods: In this experimental study, 36 rats were divided into six groups (six rats in each group): Sham-operated (SOP); CLP group; CLP+STW 5 (received doses of 2.5, 5, and 10mg\/kgBW) as treatment groups; and CLP+Indomethacin (10mg\/kgBW) as positive control. The herbal drug STW 5 and Indomethacin were injected ip, immediately after sepsis induction. After 24 hour, the rats were sacrificed and the liver tissue was qualitatively and quantitatively examined in terms of histological changes. The differences between the data were determined by one-way ANOVA and post hoc Tukey\u2019s HSD and the significant levels were defined as p<0.05. Results: The findings indicated that increased level of infiltrated and\/or sequestrated polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) and also, elevated level of histological index of the severity of liver injuries in the CLP group were not improved after treatment with Iberogast.Conclusion: Considering the results of this study, ip injection of STW 5 immediately after sepsis induction had no effect on the modulation of histological parameters related to liver damages in CLP rat model.

METHODS: a transversal populational study, including 323 deaths by uterine cervix cancer, among which 261 were recorded in the Information System about Mortality and 62 were identified after investigation on deaths by cancer at non-specified sites of the uterus. Mortality rate for all the variables was obtained and statistics for central tendency and variance were calculated. The &#967;2 test was performed to obtain the mortality coefficient concerning the living place and age range of the patients. RESULTS: death among women under 60 (54.7%), black (60.5%), single (67.6%), housewives (71.2%) and the ones living in poor neighborhood (53.3%) preponderated. Most of deaths occurred in hospitals (85.1%) and 90.2% of them occurred inside national health system hospitals. The mortality coefficient varied from 0.3 (among women under 30) to 54.9\/100.00 (among women over 80). Significant statistical differences (p<0.05) were evidenced when death linked to age range and sanitary district was compared to characteristics of the female population living in the city. CONCLUSIONS: in Recife, death by cervix cancer are more frequent among adult, black, single, housewives, women living in poor neighborhoods and attended to at national health system hospitals, with differences in death risk among age ranges and living place.",

            "abstract": "This study was conducted to obtain an epidemiological view of acaricide resistance in populations of Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus in the State of Mato Grosso do Sul. Twenty-four tick samples were collected from municipalities in the State where farmers had reported concerns about resistance to or failure of tick control. These ticks were subjected to in vitro resistance detection assays using the adult immersion test (AIT). The efficacy of alpha-cypermethrin, cypermethrin and amitraz treatments on samples collected throughout the State was generally poor. AIT showed efficacy > 90% from the use of DDVP + chlorfenvinphos) (20 out of 21 municipalities), dichlorvos + cypermethrin (10 out of 16 municipalities) and cypermethrin + citronella + chlorpyrifos + piperonyl butoxide (20 out of 21 municipalities). PCR assays were used to detect the presence of pyrethroid resistance-associated sodium channel gene mutation. Larvae from three different populations that had previously been diagnosed as pyrethroid-resistant, through AIT, were evaluated. The PCR assays showed that the pyrethroid resistance-associated gene mutation was absent from these three populations. This study confirms that the emergence of resistance is a constant challenge for the livestock industry, and that development of resistance continues to be a major driver for new antiparasitic drugs to be developed.<br>Este estudo foi realizado com o objetivo de se obter uma vis\u00e3o epidemiol\u00f3gica da resist\u00eancia aos acaricidas nas popula\u00e7\u00f5es de Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus no Estado de Mato Grosso do Sul. Vinte e quatro amostras de carrapatos foram coletadas em cidades do estado onde os fazendeiros relataram preocupa\u00e7\u00e3o com resist\u00eancia ou falha no controle dos carrapatos. Estes carrapatos foram submetidos a testes de detec\u00e7\u00e3o de resist\u00eancia in vitro usando o teste de imers\u00e3o de adultos (TIA). A efic\u00e1cia do tratamento com alfa-cipermetrina, cipermetrina e amitraz foi geralmente pobre nas amostras coletadas em todo o Estado. Obteve-se efic\u00e1cia de >90% no TIA com o DDVP + chlorfenvinphos (20 das 21 cidades), Diclorv\u00f3s + Cipermetrina (10 das 16 cidades), e Cipermetrina + Citronela + Clorpirif\u00f3s + But\u00f3xido de piperonila (20 das 21 cidades). O ensaio da PCR foi utilizado para detectar a presen\u00e7a de muta\u00e7\u00e3o do gene do canal de s\u00f3dio associado \u00e0 resist\u00eancia a piretr\u00f3ide. Avaliaram-se larvas de tr\u00eas diferentes popula\u00e7\u00f5es onde anteriormente foi diagnosticada \u00e0 resist\u00eancia por TIA. Os ensaios da PCR mostraram que a muta\u00e7\u00e3o no gene associado \u00e0 resist\u00eancia ao piretr\u00f3ide estava ausente nessas tr\u00eas popula\u00e7\u00f5es.

During a prospective study into the effects of air pollution on the health of the population of Viseu (Saud'AR Project), children with a clinical history of wheezing were identified through using the International Study of Asthma and Allergy in Childhood (ISAAC) questionnaire. Children later filled in a new standardised questionnaire and underwent skin-prick-tests, spirometry and FENO measurement. Their mean age was 7.8\u00b11.1 years. Comparing those who wheezed in the 6 months before evaluation (n=27) with those who didn\u2019t, statistical differences for \u00c4FEV1 (8% median versus 4.5%, p=0.0399) and for FENO (23 ppb median versus 12 ppb, p=0.0195, respectively) were observed. Concerning children who needed a bronchodilator in the six previous months (n=19) and those who didn\u2019t, there was also a statistically significant difference in FENO: 27 ppb median versus 11 ppb median, respectively; p<0.0001. When comparing children who needed an unscheduled medical appointment in the six months previous to the evaluation (n=9) and those who didn\u2019t, there was also significant differences for FENO: 28 ppb median versus 13 ppb median, p=0.0029. In conclusion, the existence of symptoms seems to be better related to FENO than spirometry.",

Soybean phospholipids (SPC), egg yolk phospholipids (EPC), and hydrogenated soybean phospholipids (HSPC) were selected for the preparation of different kinds of phospholipids composed of curcumin-loaded liposomes: C-SPC-L (curcumin-loaded SPC liposomes), C-EPC-L (curcumin-loaded EPC liposomes), and C-HSPC-L (curcumin-loaded HSPC liposomes). The physical properties of different lipsomes were investigated as follows: photon correlation spectroscopy revealed that the average particle sizes of the three types of curcumin-loaded liposomes were 82.37 \u00b1 2.19 nm (C-SPC-L), 83.13 \u00b1 4.89 nm (C-EPC-L), and 92.42 \u00b1 4.56 nm (C-HSPC-L), respectively. The encapsulation efficiency values were found to be 82.32 \u00b1 3.91%, 81.59 \u00b1 2.38%, and 80.77 \u00b1 4.12%, respectively. An &lt;em&gt;i&lt;\/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;n vitro&lt;\/em&gt; skin penetration study indicated that C-SPC-L most significantly promoted drug permeation and deposition followed by C-EPC-L, C-HSPC-L, and curcumin solution. Moreover, C-SPC-L displayed the greatest ability of all loaded liposomes to inhibit the growth of B16BL6 melanoma cells. Therefore, the C-SPC-L were chosen for further pharmacodynamic evaluation. A significant effect on antimelanoma activity was observed with C-SPC-L, as compared to treatment with curcumin solution &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;\/em&gt;. These results suggest that C-SPC-L would be a promising transdermal carrier for curcumin in cancer treatment.",

            "abstract": "Currently, Hodgkin's lymphoma is one of the most curable types of cancer. Patients are often young and so the long-term morbidities of treatment have become of increasing concern. Among these, infertility is one of the most challenging consequences for patients in reproductive age. Premature ovarian failure in premenopausal women is a serious long-term sequel of the toxicity of chemotherapy. The main consequence of this syndrome is infertility, but women also present other symptoms related to estrogen deprivation. Different rates of impaired gonadal function are reported, depending on the patient's age, stage of disease, dose and intensity of chemotherapy and the use of radiation therapy. The most established strategy in female infertility is cryopreservation of embryos after in vitro fertilization. Additionally, the use of oral contraceptives or gonadotropinreleasing hormone analogs (GnRH-a) during treatment is under study. This review will provide a general overview of the main studies conducted to evaluate the infertility rate among female Hodgkin's lymphoma survivors and risk factors associated to treatment, different end-point definitions for evaluating fertility and also a brief description of the available strategies for fertility preservation.",

In this study, we performed a literature review and meta-analysis to evaluate the association of uPAR expression with the prognosis of patients with GC and CRC.Method: The PubMed database was searched for material published in English, and data were then extracted and assessed by two reviewers independently. Correlations between uPAR expression and clinicopathological features and overall survival (OS) of patients with GC or CRC were analyzed.Results: A total of 2,082 patients with GC and CRC from ten studies were included. The results of the meta-analysis showed that the uPAR expression rate in GC and CRC tissues was higher than that in normal tissues (odds ratio [OR] =3.385; 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.605&ndash;4.400; P=0.000). Our meta-analysis also revealed a significant association between uPAR expression and lymph node metastasis (OR =1.366; 95% CI =1.086&ndash;1.718; P=0.008) and tumor stage (OR =3.076; 95% CI =2.330&ndash;4.061; P=0.000). Furthermore, we found that high uPAR expression correlated with poor OS (OR =1.937; 95% CI =1.570&ndash;2.930; P=0.000).Conclusion: The uPAR expression may serve as a novel disease marker in GC and CRC, as well as a therapeutic target.

The aim of current study was comparing supplemental 80% and 40% oxygen on reducing postoperative nausea and vomiting in the pediatrics undergoing strabismus surgery.\r\nMaterials and Methods: In this clinical trial study, 100 pediatric patients scheduled for strabismus surgery under general anesthesia were allocated randomly into two parallel supplemental 80% and 40% oxygen groups during surgery. PONV in patients was compared until 24hrs after operation.\r\nResults: In the first 6hrs postoperatively, PONV in the supplemental 40% and 80% oxygen groups were 48.8% and 30.6% respectively, also were 20.8% and 12.2% in the 6 to 24hrs postoperatively. Therefore, there were no significant differences between both groups in regarding of PONV in 6hrs and 6 to 24hrs postoperatively (p values were 0.18 and 0.25, respectively).\r\nConclusion: According to our results, there is no any difference between 40% and 80% oxygen postoperatively in the pediatrics undergoing strabismus surgery.\r\n",

Debt offers benefit of tax shield from interest expenses that can be deducted in calculating company income tax. Unfortunately, company can not use debts in unlimited amount because it will lead to risk of bankcrupt. Therefore, company needs to establish a target (unobserved) capital structure which will optimize the value of the firm. The purpose of this study is to investigate the determinant of capital structure and ownership in public listed companies in Indonesia Stock Exchange using Time-Series CrossSection Regression (TSCSREG) and supported with a balanced panel data. Data used are financial statements of 228 public listed companies from group of eight industry sectors. Research finding confirms that tax shield and fixed financial burden are significantly influence the capital structure and state ownership also significantly influence the capital structure of the state owned enterprises. \r\n",
